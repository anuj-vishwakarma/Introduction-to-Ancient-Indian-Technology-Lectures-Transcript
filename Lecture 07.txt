Let us start this lecture with a thought process
Basically it is not possible for any humanbeing to harm others without hurting himself
That means if you want to hurt anybody youwill have to hurt yourself first That we must
understand So for that is the thing I feltmyself and let us now recall what we learnt
in the last lecture And if you look at westarted with basically uhh what we call like
how our ancestors were doing science usingthe basic principle enact to the human being
that is like your anumana pramana and thenartha arthapati and other things
And later on we looked at like about how ourancestors very good in mathematics and giving
importance to the mathematics and also howthey have really uhh expressed the mathematics
in a very poetic and also very I want to calluhh cryptic way and later on we looked at
the physics how they were having that andthen some of the physics I have already discussed
but we will be discussing little more whatit is
Like your optics If you look at they havetold that you know that optics wise “Aprapyagrahan
kaya Bhrapatala Sfatikaant Ritoplabdha uhhthat is the basically that which cannot be
perceived by naked eye; can be perceived withthe glass or mica or crystal So this is the
things they have talked about and beside thisbasically this uhh things I have taken from
Nayadarsham adhyayah 3 and Sutram by KanadahIt is something 800 BC And he also says that
multicolour rays of the sun being dispersedby wind in a cloudy sky are seen in the form
of rainbow
All of you might have observed the rainbowI am afraid some of you may not because you
people don’t have time to watch the skyBut I had a very great experience I always
like to watch this rainbow Particularly inthe when there is a rain and there is a sun
together you know I always enjoy it of doingthat So that is being of course out ancestor
might have observed and they have talked aboutit very clearly
So uhh if you look at earth and its rotationand gravity is being talked about even like
around 500 CE that is the common era and beforethat it was there but he has Aryabhatiya has
put into together assemble and then editedthe earlier things and put in Gititka-Pada
Aryabhatiya believed that earth rotates aboutits axis and stars are fixed in space The
period of one sidereal rotation basicallyit is the yearly right And this is a latin
word and then uhh kind of things So rotationof the earth is 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1
seconds That was the prediction
And corresponding to the modern values itis almost the same That is 23 hours 56 minutes
4.091 seconds So accurately they could predictat that time It is mind boggling what they
were using how they were doing you know itis the thing to be wondered about and also
explore so that we can relearn and then dothat But how to do is a one million dollar
question so as to be looked at because wedo not know that And similar deity that is
earth Keep in mind that the uhh our ancestorswere right talking in different languages
than what we think Deity means basically wethink god but the earth itself is a god you
know they consider
By favoring attracting controlling by pullingdown the vital function called apana of the
human See and in other words let us say Inother words say Else the body would fall due
to its weight or they would fly into sky ifleft free But this word if you look at if
you get into those details you will find theseare all different things But now interpretation
and whether to map into that era is a verychallenging job
And this being taken by the Sankara’s commentarythe last portion of on the pransnopanisad
in the vedic period Actually uhh just nowI was telling to you on a informal chat that
Adi sanakara has given commentary Tika meansbasically commentary in Pransnopanisad which
is during vedic time
So in physics you know like speed of lightis very important in this Shloka which is
taken from the rig-ved samhita and of coursemandalam suktam is given 50 and mantra is
4 Tathachya smariyata yojanaan sasrang dweydwai satae dwai cha jo jane Aekena nimisardham
kramanam namastutete See actually this namaskaryou like posted kind of things altogether
this is a little high one has to interpretSo it is remember that salutation to the sun
travels with 2202 yojana is half nimisha 1nimisha is 0.1143 seconds in modern time And
if you just calculate that 1 yojana is 14.269kilometre of course there might be little
reservation about that There is a controversyalso one has to look at it
But if you consider that 2200 Yojana is basically32213.06 kilometer That means 32213.06 kilometer
and if you divide this 32213.06 divided by 0.1143
that is half nimisha right You will get something281829.03 km/s And modern speed of light is
basically the 299792 km/s Right so if youlook at it it is approximately similar Right
So uhh let us look at the chemistry Chemistryof course you know it’s a very old but uhh
people have looked at and also lot of ancientscriptures is there like rasayana sastra rasa
sastra rasa vada rasa prakriya in SanskritYou know these are the chemistry in the language
of ancient India Let me tell you that duringthis independence just before the independence
there is a PC Roy He has written the Hinduchemistry You can look at that It is a beautiful
book in English You can look at that
And chemistry is actually is not that whatwe study Remain in the abstract form But it
was very profound in you know in applicationlike in the distillation of perfumes aromatic
liquids manufacturing of dyes and pigmentsLike you know we are very good in textiles
I will be discussing about later on But thereyou need to have used dyes and pigments you
might be have gone to Ajanta and Ellora Someof you have gone Ajanta and Ellora You should
see the paintings which is very old Thereyou need dyes Okay So those are still existing
today So many years the weather conditionis changing you know like so old but still
it is existing but today modern paints ifyou use it just vanishes within maybe 5 years
or 3years or 4 years or sometimes earlieralso So what things they were doing these
are all chemistry stuff So a lot of thingswe need to look at it and not only the chemistry
but the fine arts
You know were very much because if you lookat Vedas were recited and recitation has to
be correct You know it is very important tobe Because now we call it vedparthi the person
who can learn and I am afraid that very fewvedparthis are there in the country where
veda was originated I am trying to searcha person who will teach me but I am not getting
you know in Kanpur And which was the peoplesay this is the place where you know northern
region where the veda was originated and peopleare saying but today we don’t have
And which gave rise to the finest study ofsound and phonetics Sound is a very important
so also the phonetics And we don’t caretoday about pronunciation and the natural
corollary was immergence of music or you knowif you look at Indian musics are varieties
and also it is quite profound And this depthand rigor Other forms are performing arts
right So uhh art was a thing and if you lookat mechanical and production technology if
you go to the arthashastras and also the Greekhistorians
They have actually talked about how you knowour people were doing smelting of metals and
then processing and then you know like wewill be talking about that little later on
that is about metal and mining and then metalworks and uhh how they were uhh you know distillations
of the (())(10:18) and other things we willbe talking about And it goes back to the uhh
400 you know BC Before common era right Souhh if you look at civil engineering architecture
and uhh we have already discussed about Mohenjodaroand Harappa which were something around you
know accepted by all people is 3500 BC butrecently it has dated back to the 6000 BC
which is one of the oldest other the oldestcivilization
And with blossom to highly precise scienceof civil engineering and architecture I will
be discussing about that when I will be discussingabout town planning And found expression in
innumerable monuments of the ancient IndiaWe are having uhh some of the monuments although
a lot of being destroyed because of foreigninvasions for thousand years So therefore
still we are having which is mind bogglingwhich is some of the wonders of world
So uhh let us look at is not only the aboutarchitectures and production or the arts or
the chemistry It is also games They were alsodoing lot of games right So let us look at
this If you look at this game is what youcall Any idea Snake and ladder Was it originated
in India It was Okay And this was not snakeand ladder this is the Dharmapatha The game
name was Dharmapatha Means you take the rightpath if you take the right you know path Right
you know things If you do carry out rightthings Right
Dharma dharma is basically the which is init in the old things Jadhara yete dharma that
means dharma of a man and rather ethical atheistProper rules regulation other thing then you
will go up Otherwise you will go down Rightgo up and down Ladder is basically right path
If you take then again if you take a wrongpath then you will be going coming down And
that is the spirituality Even in the gamethey put in spiritual into it Okay So uhh
let us look at this game right What you callthis game What you call Like you know uhh
there will be boxes You will have to go fromhere and then pass through that
Student 1: I think this is chopper Chopper
Sir: Chopper right This is known as pachisiand this game is across the world In north
America it is also known as pachisi RightParchisi they call But it is commonly known
as ludo But we do not know it was Earlierif you ask people They do not know It was
originated in India Let me tell you uhh thereis a lot of evidence that and I was told that
evidence is there in Ajanta and Ellora Ifsome of you visit find it out I have not visited
Okay I feel of going to see and Akbar theMughal king was very fond of this pachisi
I was told So uhh I mean like this was alloriginated We do not know We are modern that’s
why we do not know that it was there Our peoplehave devised it
And uhh what is this game These are the pointand then uhh What do you call
Student 2: This is chaupat
Sir: Chaupat what is chaupat
Student 2: Chaupat
Sir: Solitaire No This is chaturanga Whatis been used in Mahabharat Shakuni Right He
was using this pasa This portion he was uhhyou know misusing it rather and that technique
he got That is the being in our MahabharatNow this game was converted into chess And
that is an uhh this I have given you someexample There might be several as others are
there and all lost and all uhh renamed youknow We do not know So therefore we need to
look at it We need to also communicate toour youngsters The look these are the things
and people have accepted Not that I am tellingyou will accept it Okay
We do not know and if I uhh and that is wouldbe a part of education as well So if you look
at the ancient India is the birth place ofseveral games like chess ludo snake and ladder
playing cards Cards also And several otherswhich you are not aware
So therefore and it is not only about thegames I just now move into ship building and
navigation If you see the Sanskrit and thenPali I guess in Tamil it will be there Okay
Because Tamil is one of the oldest languageof India so I have several reference to maritime
activity by ancient Indians particularly thecoastal area you know You go back to Harappan
time I told you that Harappan time we arehaving dockyard Maybe I will show you when
I am talking about town planning Okay So andit will be definitely there but those things
has to be looked at it and re-establishedthat And of course there is a lot of evidence
in uhh coastal India that we are having becauseyou know kind of thing
So if you look at that uhh in ancient Indiawe are having these are the roots which is
being followed And so also here in Gujaratthis is the silk road what was having in the
land and people are having from Ganges movingover here and then going through that And
these are the coastal areas of different placesYou know these ports These are all old names
Miligigara like all those names today youmay not be knowing And there is a several
materials are going like iron steel clothIf you look at Spices right All those thing
we are exporting
We are the let me tell you that if you readthe Abdul Kalam’s book you know You will
see he has written that we are having uhhsomething around 1800 24% of the world GDP
was with us before Britisher’s Okay We area very rich country not a uhh not a under
developed country as of now Okay We are veryrich and today also we are rich Let me tell
you Rich in natural resources rich in ourwhat you call fertile land I have already
discussed that uhh earlier that what we needto do is that we need to relook at it and
consolidate ourselves so that it will be avery good country They will be rich country
and it will be having lot of potential tocontribute not only in the science and technology
and also other areas because we are intellectualssounds great
But today our youth are in different directionIf they will be coming forward and we are
having youth power and if they will be directedproperly educated properly I am sure that
we’ll do wonders and give direction notonly for our country upliftment for others
as well
So we need to learn from this lecture thatwe need to relook at ourselves and intrigate
it with our culture and heritage Whicheveris good we should accept we should learn and
which is a bad we need to skip aside and goahead So if you look at ancient Indian medicine
It is basically Ayur means life veda basicallyVeda means knowledge about knowledge about
the life about a human being and also theanimals and it is one of the oldest known
medical system in the world goes back to 6000BC you can think of 5000-6000 BC and India’s
about disease and ailments and their symptomsand how to cure them and if you look at it
is a beautiful system People have understoodand then that is more intrigated with the
nature than the modern medicine what we arehaving
That is of course my personal belief and youcan experience that and try to understand
the tenants The basic principles of that andthen try to you know process it then to use
it and then get into You will feel that wayAnd a lot of also research in modern times
have proved that it is a quite a bit goodthing to have that And we need to also research
and further the knowledge to the bettermentSo India was the first to have hospitals for
both man and animals It is not only the manSo uhh and surgery was conducted in ancient
India and if you look at surgery was consideredto be originated in India by Susruta This
thing and there is a lot of 125 surgical instrumentI have shown you few of them Here’s
It’s not that nothing was there and surgeryis a new thing It is a part of Ayurveda This
is known as Salya sikista And you can lookat this book Sushruta Samhita which is English
translation based on original Sanskrit ofcourse and uhh this is you can see and read
it and also feel good about it and use it
So we need to have a house We do housing rightyes or no And we use concrete isn’t it These
are if you look at these are concretes andcements these are your iron rods for enforcing
reinforced concreted And we will have a flatroof okay Yes or no Right and we use a lot
of iron and as a result we produce a lot ofpollution also and we take out the metal from
the earth and we also you know cut the mountainsand make great gravels And then we use it
and then if we are having 130 crore peopleand if everybody wants to have a this kind
of house then where will go and this houselife is around something what is the life
span of this kind of houses
Any idea maybe around 50-60 years kind ofthings and 56 years again I will have to go
and cut the thing Get the iron and other thingsSo is it possible that we will afford to give
this kind of houses to all the people Buteverybody wants to have that Is there any
other way of doing it So can you make a roofof a house without concrete and iron rod of
course you will have to go back and then thisthing that beam
You know earlier days we used to give woodenbeam You might have seen in olden house I
had seen in my house we are having Woodenbeam right And then uhh stiffs will be given
right But let us say we don’t want to giveWhere is the wood because jungles are not
there All the human being have being filledwith the land in India Right 130 crore people
So is there any other way of doing it Anyidea So let me tell you I visited this place
This is a place in Kanpur Right And this isShivrajpur temple in Kanpur and this is the
roof of the house which is located just onthe side of river Ganga Okay And that is maybe
300-400 years or more than that I do not knowI have not dated it But if you look at these
are the bricks and then choona Choona meanlime and sand You can make that and it is
so strong lastly Nobody is lying there uhhis there And nobody is taking care of it
And it is on the bank of Ganga subjected towater rain and what not and then you know
force of the Ganga uhh water of the Gangaduring uhh what you call rainy seasons flood
Now it is a doable but I do not know the technologyright So therefore we need to relook at it
It is important to look at the science inancient time and use it today
Let us look at the view of few scholars andyou must be knowing uhh Heisenberg German
physicist Who says that after the conversationsabout Indian philosophy some of the ideas
of quantum physics that had seem so crazysuddenly made much more sense It is the Heisenberg
who is saying not me It means you know weneed to look at our own you know Indian philosophy
How many of you are aware We showed at leastif not all of you some of you should take
interest Okay So similarly Rele who is theJewish writer who says our present knowledge
of the nervous system fits in so accuratelywith the internal description of the human
body given in the Vedas something 5000 yearsago what it will
Says then the question arises whether theVedas really religious books or books on anatomy
of the nervous system or medicine But letme tell you We are not aware what is there
They are saying we should know With this Iwill stop over Thank you very much
