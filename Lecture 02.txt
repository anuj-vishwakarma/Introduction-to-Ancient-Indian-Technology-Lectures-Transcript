Let us start this lecture with a thought processthat man is a curious and creature by nature
which I had emphasized in the last lectureI also had told in the last lecture and this
isÖthese are the two characteristics by whichman has harnessed the science and technology
for a uhh what you call quality life
And if you recapitulate that what we learntin the last lecture we started looking at
what is the meaning of science then we lookedat what is the meaning of technology and how
technology is different from engineering Andthen we also looked at that in our ancient
time we were having Shilpa and what is thedefinition of Shilpa which is a combination
of engineering and technology of course inEnglish we call industry
And that is why by which you produce a productby using different processes and that we learnt
And also we looked at that the India in earlierdays we called it as Bharat which was dwelling
upon harnessing the knowledge that is themeaning of Bharat And we have a knowledge
society we are having And what are the strengthwe are having not only the geographically
but also the uhh wealth wise resources Andwe are having a very great human resources
as I had emphasized they are intelligent andhard-working people right
And that is why I also related that corruptionis there in this country because they are
intelligent and (hard) energetic people andthat is why we are corrupted But if they were
directed properly by imparting better educationthey will be the adventure of development
in this country So India is is not reallya poor country it is poorly managed country
I had emphasized
Beside this we had looked at the chronologicalaspect of the various dynasty starting from
the prehistoric era and Indus Valley Civilizationsubsequently uhh the Vedic civilizations and
then the uhh what you call other dynastieslike your Mauryan dynasty and then uhh your
Gupta periods and then there are several Pallavasand Cholas in south southern side And there
are several dynasty we have looked at it
So uhh as I told you that recently the IITKharagpur have done research and published
in the very prestigious journal Nature thatour civilization is not started with the 3000
BC rather it is something around 6000 or 7000BC kind of things So that is a new input from
that and which isÖquestion arisesÖwe area part of Indus Valley Civilization we should
feel proud of it
And question arises then what do you meanby civilization Because we say that we are
a part of a great civilization which is stillexisting today and a part of you know our
culture and rituals are very much integratedwith the Indus Valley Civilization But what
do you mean by civilization Can anybody tellme Civilization word is basically Latin word
that means you are civilized Earlier dayspeople were moving in jungles they were not
civilized
Student: Sir in my opinion civilization isa way of life of a group of peopleÖ
Professor: Yes
Student: Öwho do uhh businesses for mutualwelfare
Professor: Welfare Any any other things Heis right and there is a group of people
Student: It can be a base or evolution ofcertain practice or anything
Professor: Practice having certain cultureand certain philosophy and then life What
else Any other things So therefore we cancallÖ
Student: There is a use of technology
Professor: Yes that is important And theyalso harness the technology for a better life
Therefore we can call I mean like this isa definition what I have framed
You may find different definition in the literatureCivilization is a human society with advanced
agricultural practice because food is importantI told you Our ancestor has told ëanna pratishta
devaí So ëannaí is very important
And with abundant food to donate donationis a part of our life (time) from since time
immemorial Today we are not donating we arenot giving We are feeling bad to give we are
becoming more you know like what you callkeeping everything holding it But that is
thing that is the sign of civilized peopleAnd administrative structure for governance
it is not that you will do whatever you wantyou should have governance
And higher level of spirituality which isthe basis of Indus Valley Civilization or
(Indi) (Indo) Indus-Sarasvati Civilizationnowadays we are calling it And the science
and technology And certain innate culturefor leading a harmonious and fruitful life
harmony is important and that is being talkedabout in our scriptures Several times it is
being emphasized that you will have to leada harmonious and a fruitful meaningful life
You should not live like a an animal fromthe very morning to the night you will be
running for the food producing or doing Youshould have certain goal certain philosophy
in life So that is what that we will be askingthat question Therefore we call that as a
civilization Of course there might be smallthings are there here and there but I have
tried to sum it up as a definition of civilizationIs it making sense to you Is there anything
missing in this definition If it is so thenwe can discuss later on If you are having
now we can discuss
So now question arises how to identify a civilizationIn other words what are the signatures of
identifying whether it is a civilization itis a good or bad or ugly civilization or what
is it is So in other words how to identifya civilization What are the properties characteristics
If you look at the definition I have givenmost of the characteristics are included
So I am giving a clue to answer this questionThat means what
Student: There should be good food arrangements
Professor: Yes definitely
Student: There should be good administrativebodies
Professor: Yes WhatÖ
Student: It will be more systematic
Professor: Systematic That means people willbe having staying in together That is also
very important part And they will be stayingmeans there should be habitats like and there
should be good construction of houses hutsand then these things right That means if
you look the urban and rural settlements willbe there right
And so also the primary producer of food theyshould produce themselves They should not
you know like what you call import They shouldhave their own food self-reliant not depend
on other And paying surplus to deity saintsñ Today also you know if you look at in this
country we may be having something 2 lakhsto 3 lakhs of saints who lives on others We
donate them and they take food
Even today we say we may be poor but we stillkeep And that practice is a great practice
which is from the time immemorial it is withus And monumental architecture and art art
is a part of life Art is very important forhuman being but we do not have time today
to think about art and culture
So and that needs a very peaceful and lifeAnd system for recording informations if you
look at whatever the you know like Veda weare having a scriptures which is veryÖone
of the oldest rather that is the oldest scripturesin the entire world And beautiful you know
thought processes and so exotic so sophisticatedin the nature I sometimes feel how they framed
those things at at that time So we are havingthat
And development of exact and practical sciencetoday we talk about science we are teaching
science from the class 1 maybe from KG onwardsBut we are not teaching the science them We
are just making them to remember right
So then it is not science So they should knowpractical aspect If you look at science when
I define and say that science in Hindi orin Sanskrit we call ëVigyaní ëVishesh Gyaní
Basically science is what Science is commonsense at the best right But we make it sophisticated
and complicated and then psychic the peoplenot to take the science and mathematics That
we are doing and we are saying we are educating
So therefore science and that to practicalaspect of science is also very important and
interdependent of classes If you look at likeour caste people are saying ìOh!
Caste is badî and all those things Of coursecaste in the present form is horrible but
caste does not mean It is basically classificationof the people like peasants craft people intellectual
rulers It is always there that is the partof the things right
So it was a part of our society state andits governance And if you look at democracy
is basically originated in this country Mostof you may not be aware right And philosophy
we are having a great philosophy Of courserecently we are not contributing to philosophy
because we are running from pillar to postfor the food and we do not know what we are
doing We are busy in our (noth) for nothingTherefore we do not have time to think right
So and then we haveÖwe do not have much fillersBut we are having a very you know plethora
of philosophy and in our scriptures And spiritualityit is the base of our life And even today
people are being attracted to this countryfor spirituality And we have having unique
unique cultural values which are recedingday by day So these are the things what we
are having And if you look at what are theoldest civilization of the world Can anybody
tell me Because Indus Valley Civilizationis fine we are a part of it But what are the
other in civilizations oldest civilizations
Student: Mesopotamia
Professor: Yes Any other
Student: Harappan civilization
Professor: Harappan is Indus Valley CivilizationRight what we are discussing now Anybody Minor
civilization yes fine There are several ofthem but I have just jotted down the Mesopotamia
civilization what people are saying something3500 to 750 BC Then next oldest is the uhh
Indus Valley civilization 3000 to 1500 BC
If you look at IIT Kharagpur research hasshown that we are older than the Mesopotamia
And recent this thing and which has been publishedin journal very prestigious journal Nature
And Mayan that is 2600 and 700 BC; Chinese2070 to 300 BC; Greek 800 to 500 BC; Roman
600 to 300 BC I must tell you that these numbersI have taken that which people have accepted
maybe some people will claim something elseother thing there always a variation Do not
go by the numbers But these are theÖBut ifyou today look at go to that place find out
is that civilization is dead or it is stillthere Those civilizations
If you look at there are dead You do not getany signature from them But in this country
I am very proud to say that we are havingsignature of the civilization what was existing
during Indus Valley even before But unfortunatelybecause of cultural invasion today by the
market forces in this country without ourknowledge it is being going out at an alarming
rate
So therefore we became also like that maybe50 within 50 or 100 years And therefore that
is the main motivation for me to take thisonerous task of doing this course although
I am not a qualified person to do this Sothat is the reason I would urge upon people
to feel that you are a part of a great civilizationwhich is still living about to die and dedicate
your life for keeping it alive and also removethe whatever the destruction it is having
and keep the main essence of it and also takeforward So with this I would like to urge
upon you this through this medium so thatyou can do
So question arises what are the specialityof Indian civilization Why it is so Can anybody
tell me
Student: Sir there was so much decentralizationof resources at that point of time So uhh
means people do not have to dependent uponuhh very much upon the administrative bodies
Professor: Yes That means the self governance
Student: Yes
Professor: They were governed by themselvesIt is the society was what you call governing
the governance But today it is other way aroundIt is the top-down approach Earlier days bottom-up
approach Yes there will be king there willbe administrator but they will not interfere
in the day-to-day ofÖthey will not controlthe life of the people the freedom Freedom
is the basis of our this thing
Today even today also we love freedom Butwe are notÖwe are being chained without our
knowledge with market driven materialism andalso the uhh the administrators So if you
look at we are having you know well plannedrule in urban areas in the Indus Valley Civilization
Advanced science and technology that we willbe discussing about: What are the technology
we are having How it is higher and scientificlanguage
I will tell you that our language is veryscientific in nature And we are having plethora
of literature most of them are being destroyedbut still we areÖwhatever we are having the
level is very high The level are quite highAnd the we are having joint family concept
Even today although it is being turmoiledor the dwindling but still we believe in the
joint family culture which is a very important
And spiritual practices and Indian philosophyand love for Mother Nature that is very important
And that is the basis with which ancient Indianscience technology were evolved out because
we believe that ñ even if you go to the scriptureyou will see ìJawat tishtati bhumandale saile
bankanan taawat tishtati mediniyam santatiputra pautriî
That means it is being told that as long asyou take care of the mountains forest and
the gardens and the nature so long you aretaking care of theÖnot destroying them live
with them then you will beÖMother Naturemediniyam this earth Mother Nature will be
taking care of you not only you but also yournext generations
So that is the thing what we need to But todaymodern science is against the Mother Nature
so that I will be talking about it So it isvery important that today Even even it is
there in your heart we are not against thenature because it is my mother So can a son
or daughter will go against the mother NoSo therefore that ethos is very important
And unity in diversity you may find that severallanguages several kinds of people the several
cultures are together but they are being boundedby the one thread that is humanity what I
call spirituality So balance in life is importantIt is not that you will run after the money
you will have to run after the power It isthe balance which is important
So also the searching for the ultimate truthbecause our scripture says that ëbrahmam
satyam jagat sfoorti jeevanam satya shodhanamíThat means if I look at ëbrahmaí which is
the ultimate thing that is brahmam satyamthat is truth And jagat whatever the going
on it is all dynamics in actions sfoorti inaction You always will have to do something
you know like it is not that you will be sittingidle and doing nothing taking the food that
what we do nowadays not doing anything right
So this is sfoorti And jeevanam satya shodhanthat means you are here to search the truth
that is the ultimate truth And that is thebasis by which science and technology being
done in search of truth So truth is importantTherefore that has to be done and that is
our ancestor has talked about it
So it is if you look at the Vincent ArthurSmith a historian from 1848 to 1920 he has
given his view on India: India beyond alldoubt possesses a deep underlying fundamental
unity far more profound than that producedeither by geographical isolation or by by
political superiority That unity transcendsthe innumerable diversities We are having
diversities in this country of blood colorlanguage dress manners and sects but still
we are united
That is the thing that is unity in diversityAnd let me tell you India is not a country
it is a continent having so many climatesso many what you call languages so many uhh
what you call uhh biodiversities India isnot a country it is a continent is a subcontinent
we call it right It is not a continent ratherit is a subcontinent So therefore having a
lot of capabilities and let me just tell youthat how do you call like I mean basically
what is the gift Indiaís civilization giftto the world
So it is a prodigious lucrative civilizationNow people are very creative because they
were having freedom When their freedom thereis a food they will be creative by default
As I told man is a creative curious and creativecreature by nature we are spoiling them in
the name of education
And that had contributed that is this civilizationhad contributed for the welfare of the people
around the globe It is not only for us itis across the globe We are having interaction
with Mesopotamia Persia Central Asia EgyptGreek Roman China Southeast Far East Asia
and several other countries We do learn fromthem It is not that we only give because it
is exchange for kind of things
And we have also looked at not copy and pastethe way we are doing today We understand and
then do because our Veda says ìLearn fromeverywhere wherever it goes but you must understand
and integrate with your cultural values withyour heritage and then adopt it as emulative
not just to swallow it because otherwise itwill be indigestible (())(21:51)î That is
the thing what is happening today So thereforebe careful I am not saying that learnÖ do
not learn from others but learn by properlyunderstanding how it will be useful to you
and other thing And that is the what our civilizationhas done
Sri Aurobindo says Sri Aurobindo you peoplemight be knowing who had lived in Pondicherry
contributed lot of thing to the modern philosophyof India and spirituality ìAnd she expandsÖshe
means is Mother India expands too outsideher brothers her ships cross the ocean and
the fine (spiri) superfluityÖ superfluitymeans basically excess of her wealth because
India was a wealthy country That is why lotof were coming to this to take that wealth
and enjoy that And brims over to Judea peoplewere calling it as basically ësone ka chidiyaí
that means it is a country where you can getgold rightî
ìSo therefore her colonies spread her artsand epics and creeds in archipelago; her traces
are found in the sands of Mesopotamia; herreligions conquer the China and Japan spread
the westward as well as Palestine They conquerthem but not sending a single soldier They
are culturallyÖactually the China and Japanwere influenced a lot by Indian culture not
by sending by brutal force That is a veryimportant thingî
ìAnd spread the westward as far as the PalestineAlexandria and figures of Upanishads and sayings
of Buddhists are echoed on the lips of ChristEverywhere on her soil so in her works there
is the teeming of superabundant energy oflifeî And that energy of life I could see
today among you But those energy are not beingchannelized properly due to bad education
according to me And once it is channelizedwe will be a great country without any doubt
and we can give knowledge we can contributeto theÖfor the welfare of the world because
we believe in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam everyall are a family That is the humanity
So therefore if you look at contribution weare having a great contribution in spirituality
and religion Philosophy we are having a sixset of philosophies and several others And
sociology we are having a very good socialsystem Let me just discuss little bit about
it We are having varnashrama how many of youare aware Can you tell me what are those
Student: Varnashrama ek vyavstha thi Esmechaar varnomein baata gaya tha Means BrahmanÖ
It was a system of society in which societywas uhh divided in four groups Brahmin Kshatriya
VaishyaÖ
Professor: No no that is not Varna Varnashramameans uhh basically it is uhh what you call
the total life spanÖ
Student: Okay okay
Professor: ÖÖperson is divided into fourparts
Student: Four parts okay
Professor: One isÖ
Student: Brahmacharya GrihasthaÖ
Professor: ÖBrahmacharya uhh okay One isBrahmacharya other is Grihastha the (tha)
third is Vanaprastha the fourth is SanyasaSo if you look at that Brahmacharya in student
life is very important A person has to developa firm control over his sense organs right
Because once you control the sense organsof yours you will have to learn well because
those are the things you need for learninganything new
And once you do that then you will go andhave a what you call uhh married life and
where you will have to also harness thoseknowledge and sense organs use them for the
propagation of life and also contribute tothe society do a life what you want to and
also satisfy your desires and aspirationsAnd then after that you will have to go for
a vanaprastha where you will have to detachfrom this day-to-day life of married life
and other things and contribute for the welfareof the society
And later on once welfare of the society youdo then you will go for renunciation and you
will go for the higher level of thing So ifyou look at basically if I will concentrate
on the vanaprastha vanaprastha is basicallya beautiful thing where you will be thinking
of your own for doing good to the societyIn today if you look at which is the the vanaprastha
is generally from the age of something 50to 75 if you consider 100 years of age of
a person which was a very common earlier days
Even if you consider today the total maybearound something 20 crore people of this country
will be there If 20 crore people start thinkingabout the welfare of the society society will
be great And they are thinking not by thegovernment force by the government or some
other they are doing from their own self Thatis a beautiful system of sociology which is
not there anywhere in the world or any otherform to best of my knowledge
If I amÖif something is there I will be veryhappy to learn because my knowledge is limited
limitation my knowledge is limited So thereforethat is a beautiful system There several other
systems are there of sociology people arenot looking at it savvy Similarly education
system gurukul system were very beautifulsystem And we are the first to have a university
in the entire world right
And that is uhh and management psychologyPsychology if you look at Abraham Maslow he
has taken a concept from the Taittiriya Upanishadthat is Panchakosha I do not want to elaborate
that You people should look at it And thisis similar thing And he became a famous because
taking that and not acknowledging that hehas taken that from that And we (pe) poor
people we are not looking at it right So thatis the thing I would like to urge you people
please look at our own scriptures use it andeven modern time it can be utilized That is
the objective of this course to make you awarethat we are having plethora of the knowledge
informations which (you) can be utilized today
So and we have language is great and scriptsalso And literature and arts Agriculture we
are very good today Organic farming what youwere talking about basically Indian agricultural
methodology has come in the organic farmingTextiles mathematics astronomy medicine physics
and metaphysics mining and metallurgy andchemical technology ship technology some of
these things we will be discussing not allbecause this is very introductory course
Let me tell you what this Sir Monier-Williamsthe Sanskrit-English Dictionary who is writing
a preface for this he has written: The Hindushave made considerable advances in astronomy
algebra arithmetic botany and medicine notto mention their superiority in grammar Grammar
is very beautiful grammar system we are havingnow and long before some of the science were
cultivated by most of the ancient nation ofEurope Hence it has happened that I have been
painfully reminded during the progress ofthis dictionary that is a Sanskrit lexicographer
ought to aim at the kind of quasi-omniscience
It is almost science what they are sayingas a grammar you know that is true But we
are not being taught properly the grammarthe Ashtadhyayi and other thing
So I will tell you also what Swami Vivekanandahas told about our civilization: Civilization
have arisen in other parts of the world Inancient and modern times wonderful ideas have
been carried forward from one race to anotherBut mark you my friends it has been always
with the blast of war trumpets and the marchof embattled cohorts You know they have put
force together You know they used the armsand ammunition to you know place or force
the culture right
And each idea had to be soaked in the delugeof blood Each word or power had to be followed
by the groans of millions by the wails oforphans by the tears of widows And this many
other nations have taught Right These arethe things they have taught But the India
for thousands of years peacefully existedHere the activity prevailed when the Greece
did not exist Even the earlier when the historyhas no record and tradition dare not peerÖtraditions
and the tradition dares not peer into thegloom of that intense past even from until
now ideas after ideas marched out from herbut every word has been spoken with a blessings
behind it and peace before it
We all of we of all nations of the world havenever been a conquering race and the blessing
is on our head and therefore we live So uhhwe have seen that how Swami Vivekananda has
talked about our civilization What we willsee that we will see what Alan Watts has talked
about our civilization
He says that to the philosophers of Indiahowever Relativity is no new discovery You
know the theory of relativity was you knowepoch-making in what you call discovery But
for Indians it is not because they have livedwith that Just as the concept of light years
is no matter for astonishment to the peopleused to think of time in millions kalpas Are
you getting Light years you know 3 into 10power to 8 meter per second right Is it Am
I right No noÖ
Student: Sir into 360
Professor: So all right But the a kalpa isbasically 432 billions of years We cannot
think even today I mean they have thoughtabout what is the kalpa And the fact that
the wise men of India have not been concernedwith technological application of this knowledge
they were having knowledge but they did notapply it that way modern people have done
Why Why it is they did not do that Can anybodytell me Think about it we will discuss
And arises from the circumstance the technologyis but one innumerable ways of applying it
Let me tell you the technology what we aredoing today we are using technology and then
we are not using the mind to develop Our ancestorswere very much keen to develop a mind so that
they will conceive the magnanimity of theBrahman Therefore the technology is today
against us developing theÖexpanding the horizonof mind That is why they were not doing that
according to my interpretation
So therefore India let me just tell a quotefrom the Will Durant American philosopher
what he has told: India was the motherlandof our race the Sanskrit the mother of Europeís
languages The Sanskrit also is the motherof almost all languages in this country and
is having a very good you know grammar thatis known as Ashtadhyayi Let me tell you that
today we do not have people who really havinga good knowledge out of 130 crore (who) in
Ashtadhyayi
It is such a bad situation today and withoutwhich we cannot understand Vedas We cannot
understand lot of scriptures without knowingthe grammar properly So she was she was means
Mother India was the mother of our philosophyMother means creator The mother through the
Arabs of much of our mathematics That meansthrough the Arab this mathematics which is
originated in India went to the European countries
Mother through the Buddha of the ideals embodiedin Christianity mother through the village
community We are having a community livingand western people are adopting but we are
living it right And of the self-governmentself-governance is the part and parcel of
our ancestors and the democracy The MotherIndia is many ways the mother of us all He
says that Will Durant the American philosopher
And nothing that not only this but he saysnothing should be more deeply shame the modern
student modern student of America okay thanthe decency of inadequacy of his acquaintance
with India If look at he asking that you arenot acquainted with the Indian knowledge or
Indian culture and heritage you should feelashamed But how many of you haveÖare aware
of Indian philosophy today That is theÖweshould feel more ashamed than the Americans
He should be aware and that is the objectivewith which I am doing this course for you
people and taking lot of pain I wish thatyou should work hard and do contribute for
theÖin propagation of this knowledge andalso do research on that So this is the India
that patient scholarship scholarship cannotbe get in a hurry the way we live a life in
today all busy for nothing So the patientscholarship is now opening up like a new intellectual
continent to the Western mind which only yesterdaythought civilization an exclusive Western
thing
Because before the excavation of this IndusValley Civilization in Harappan region people
were not knowing India was having anythingbut later on people have found that we are
having plethora of it So that idea has beengone but it is still in our mind that we are
having nothing We are having lot of thingand we are also today having energetic and
what you call intelligence mind (intelle)intellectual mind that will be So with this
I will tell you that what will be the coursecontent
I will start give introduction: Why our ancientIndian science and technology relevant today
And we will be discussing about ancient Indianscientific methods being adopted to harness
the science and technology glimpses of ancientIndian science and technology I will be talking
about
Later on I will be moving about agriculturetechnology being adopted now which is coming
to our country as a organic farming That isthe same thing old wine in new bottle and
it is coming to us And our what you call foodbeing more costlier because you know the technology
has come from outside but it is our own technology
So water harvesting technology and irrigationsystems which is a very beautiful It is far
superior than the what we are adopting fromthe western people Rural and town planning
which is also equally good Building constructionsanitation and I will tell you how we can
reduce the cost how we can adopt those technologyeven today and which will be more environmental
benign And also the cost-effective (techni)textile technology
And I will be discussing our material technologyvarious aspect mining metals metallurgy iron
making craftsmanship means basically And wootzsteel which was a very important one I will
be talking about that
Extraction of zinc in ancient India glassmaking bead making (takin) and ceramic technology
and some other things also depending on thetime I will be trying to cover With this I
will uhh end this lecture saying that we knowthat what is the India what is the ancient
civilization how great were our ancestorswere and what they contributed and what is
the philosophy behind that
So I have tried to give you glimpses of thatbut however you will have to read study and
do that And uhh I in the next lecture I willbe giving you some reference to study that
so that you can look at some differences Andas I go along I will be talking about the
references which you can look for you knowknowing more about this course Thank you very
much
