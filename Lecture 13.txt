Let us start this lecture with a third processthat agriculture is the true culture of Indian
civilization You must recall which I had toldearlier that Indian civilization is the only
living civilization from time emorialrightOther most of the other old civilization are
dead because we consider agriculture is veryimportant and in the last lecture if you recall
that we discuss about how our ancestors whostarted cultivating I related to the story
of the narrative of Lord Krishna and LordBalram who is also known as Haldar hal means
plow
And beside this we also looked at varioustools like starting from the digging stool
stick to the hoe then various kinds of hoeaxes and lot of other tools we looked at but
if you could recall well that we were discussingabout plough Plough is very important and
which was ahh you know invented accordingto me in this country long time back of course
as per as our narrative goes on
And so we will have to look at how preciselyit is given the about the design of the plough
in Krisi-Parasara and if you look at differentparts have given and one is Yuga in English
but it is yoke basically ear-shaped yoke rightSorry Yuga in Sanskrit but it is ear-shaped
yoke that is known as Karnasamanka and thereis Addacalla and which is basically the pins
of yoke and which is around twelve Angulasmeans nine inches kind of things for tying
the bullocks this terminology let me introduceafter that we will see each one of them and
corresponding to the figure so that it willbe very clear to you
Isa Isa is basically pole of a plough whichis around 5 cubit long in meter if you convert
it is 2.25 meter as one cubic is around 0.45meter We had also looked at this unit conversion
in the last lectureAnd Niryola or you cancall it Nir Yola the plough proper without
ploughshare and which is around something0.7 meter and Saula that is also La you can
say and extra piece of wood tightly fixedwhich is used to fixed the Niryola to the
pole and Niryolapasika is another componentof the plough that is basically a plate that
fixes the ploughshare to the Niryola whichis around 22 centimeter kind of things
And Halasthanu it is basically hal means ploughand sthanu means you will have to hold it
and this strong piece of wood fixed to Niryolaat the end of opposite to the ploughshare
it is (())(3:43) which is around 1.1 meterAnd there is Abandha a iron cylindrical rod
sometime wood peg also being used that preventsthe Niryola from falling out of the pole and
Yoktra is basically a rope which is beingused for tying the yoke right kind of things
And Phala is the main thing which will betearing the soil whenever the plough ploughing
is being done and if you look at early dayspeople were using this Phala or the ploughshare
made of wood in the last lecture we had seenyou know around 800 to 1000 BC people started
using iron for this ploughshare in India andof course this is the some of the things figures
if you look at this is your this ploughshareis not being shown here but the share body
is given and this is your beam which we callit as a basically the Isa the pole and this
is the hand grip or the Halasthanu
So this is a picture so what I am showingyou know that you know this is being done
together that means there is a ploughing goingon and also the broadcasting of seeds both
are going on together in this figure and sowhat I was talking about how to this is the
basically the yoke right and this is youryoke beam and this is peg which is connected
so that this ox can be tied properly you knowthis way and there is of course this yoke
is connected to the Isa that is the pole withthe wire here and sometimes you can have it
joint with a rod also iron being used nowdays particularly and if you look at this
figure here it is a design is little morekind of constant for the ox
But here there is design which is in betweenthese two wooden rod you can say the ox can
will be moving right it is there a flexibilityand there is being used also rope and you
can observe from here there is a wooden plankwhich there on which the man is sitting standing
sorry man is standing So why it is so whatis the purpose of this that might be coming
into your mind we will discuss as we go along
So this is the as I told the yoke is basicallya wooden crosspiece that is fastened over
the neck of oxen two oxen and attached tothe plough or a cart because we can use for
ploughing and also we can use this yoke withthe help of oxen We can also you know drive
the cart for the transportation purposes
So Yuga if you look at this is basically thisshaped is ear-shaped yoke like this is the
you can say Karnasamanka and Addacalla whichis a basically this one but I will show you
in the next slide may be that this is canbe used to wooden rods can be used that is
also known as Addacalla which is around 12Angulas and 9 inches right And this is used
for tying the bullet right or you can sayOx being used right
So if you look at this is the Addacalla whichwas being basically used this is the one and
there will be another one if you look at thereis a hole here right and there will be another
person which you can put into this rod andthen you can in between this portion that
Ox can be placed and you can use some wherethe rope can be from here to there so that
you can use that way
So they are same you know things but it isdesigned differently this is more flexible
than that of the things that we have usedand there are several varieties of these you
can get in India that is the beauty of thatthat for the same purpose various design will
be available which will be varying from oneregion to another and Isa if you look at is
the pole of the plough and which is around2.25 meter you know this is the Isa what is
having it can be made of wood it can be madeof bamboo as well right people have used depending
on what is available
And according to me bamboo may be better offbecause it is lighter and the load will be
less and it is also the (())(8:59) littleflexible also that is the one part and it
is having a better life it can take more loadas such and it will be cheaper as compared
to wood even at this moment of time So thereforethat can be that is being used by the various
people but not in all places in this countrybecause bamboo is being grown in some place
and those places it is being used
Niryola is the plough proper without ploughshareso if you look at ahh this is the Niryola
right which is around this portion if youlook at 0.7 meter this portion you known if
you look at this is the portion which willbe Niryola kind of thing there is another
portion which is there in this place and withoutploughshare ploughshare is this one I will
show you this is Niryola I think this figureis better this is one piece right one piece
here like that it goes and of course thisis your ploughshare and which is the extra
piece of wood you know is being tightly fixedto Niryola with a pole this is the one pole
but there is another term being used
There are two wooden pieces being used herefor joining this Niryola with the pole this
is your pole or Isa what you call it is jointso you have a peg will have to put you can
say it is basically peg which will tightenit and when it will move it will not really
come out because it is moving in the samedirection if you look at this is a width is
higher and this is lower so it is as it ismoving in this way so it will be remaining
fixed and will not come out and it will betight tight enough also
So and there is another one here which isalso joining this with that one that is known
as Saula and Yoktra that is basically a ropewhich is being used and this is the portion
is known as Yoktra like which by which theycan also control the movement of the oxen
it can be go to the left it can go to rightyou know that way they can do by tying this
one So if you look at the farmer who is ploughingwill have a control over the Ox movement or
Oxen movement that is the thing what is beingused
And Niryolapasika that is the plate fixedthe ploughshare this is the portion Niryolapasika
right and of course this whatever I am showingis made of Iron right But earlier days and
even today also in some parts of the countrythis is made of wood right this Niryolapasika
and which is around twenty two centimetersin length and of course if you go to some
other book there also what is the width andeverything is given not in this case Krisi-Parasara
And if you look at for this thing this ploughsay I went around something 60 kilometres
from the CT inside and it was very frustratingto search and get now days because most of
the people are using tractor I am afraid mayafter 10 20 years this plough which was being
used in this country profusely will not bethere and there is no person I was also asking
the farmer that the person who is making isnot there because those people are jobless
so they are also not doing
So the indigenous technology is going outof our life at a rapid rate and this should
be kept with us because people can do notthe company there is a difference because
here the people can also design and changeso that their creativity will be retained
and also their need can be fulfilled So theknowledge will be with the people not with
a company or some specific people set of peoplewho will be really misusing and then scooping
out money out of this and then whole peoplewill be active and creative in nature which
is the basic nature of human being
Therefore indigenous technology should bekept and it is a very simple one and from
the nature you can make you need not dependon the lot of things so that is the important
point I would like to emphasize I will bedoing it again and again because that is the
point for which you know I want to communicateto you and that is my main motive that why
will you go for indigenous technology andhow we can make our life more creative and
more purposeful and more peaceful and morewhat do you call satisfied in you know satisfied
life how we can maintain it
So the Halasthanu what I was telling a strongpiece of wood this is the piece of wood you
know what is being joint this is known asHalasthanu right fixed to the Niryola this
is Niryola and to the end of opposite sideof ploughshare is something around 1.1 meter
And I have shown the Halasthanu here and herealso both the cases you can see and why it
is given and in because you will have to givelittle pressure so that this ploughshare will
be entering into the soil and this angle ofthe ploughshare is very important okay
So one question might be coming to you whywill use the plough why not the tractor right
that might be question to you because tractoris more powerful and it can also till the
land for a at a faster rate there are severalproblems with a tractor one is there will
be pollution and you will have to pay themoney you know not only maintenance of the
tractor tractor is very costly and it is athe pollution will be there and you will have
to depend here you can use rear the Ox andtheir cow and cow dung cow dung and then urine
and other things you can utilize as a fertilizermanures and also the insecticide and pesticide
lot of things can be made indigenously
So that you need not to pay money right andwhen you rear these things you will get lot
of psychological benefits also and was tellingthat there is a angle this Halasthan this
angle is very important See this is havingsome angle here alpha right and this angle
should be designed properly so that forceyou know will be getting vertically when I
make this thing this would be having verticalforce and this would be horizontal force so
that force has to be giving some little pressureon that okay
So this has if you look at one can also lookat whether it is optimized or not or optimally
designed or not right but lot of work canbe done on this to improve further it is not
that it is the final one
So Abandhar that is the ironwood cylindricalrod that prevents Niryola from falling out
of the pole There are two terms which is similarbut I think one of them will be for the this
and another will be that there is a thingwhich I think one has to look at it okay
So Phala Phala is the main thing ploughsharewhich will do the job of tearing this is the
phala This angle is very important becausethat angle will decide this angle you know
whatever it is going with that rather thisangle this angle If I say Alpha or may be
Alpha of I can say PhalaPhala or the ploughshareright is very important because that will
decide the depth of the soil which can beyou know taken out from the the land or the
ground or the field so that it will not getinto deep and why it is so any idea Why not
we make it more angle so that it will youknow take out the or the tear the land further
with the depth wise and so that it will bebetter
And there is also provision how much it willbe we will see that and as compared to the
tractor this depth which can be achieved bythe plough is much smaller and that is is
important point because if you look at thetop soil is very important right it should
not go to the bottom soil and that will beaffecting the what do you call fertility of
the soil
So we will be discussing about later on butyou think about and also explore yourself
why plough is superior as compared to thetractors what is being you know trench is
being used So far the tearing the land isconcerned depth wise right So that is the
important point one has to understand right
So if you look at the preparation of the soilis very important and that is why the plough
is being used and you will have to also usemanures right and you need also the irrigation
irrigation means you will have to supply necessarywater what is required for a particular crop
And ploughing of field is also important soalso sowing seeds and methodology what is
being used and as per our text is concernedother scripture whatever you call earlier
text right There are three main activitiesof you know plantation or you can say farming
what is that one is of course the preparationof the soil that is anyway you will have to
do apart from irrigation manuring is one ploughingis one and sowing of seeds is these three
are you know important
And cultivator must or a farmer must be wellacquainted with soil seed and season There
are three S if you look at right three S andthe soil is very important we should know
what kind of soil it is what kind of cropwe can have so also the seed Today we you
may be surprised to know farmer today do nothave the knowledge of seed because they are
buying from the market right
And they do not know earlier days they werenot only knowing the seed and they know also
how to improve the quality of seed and howto preserve it and how to get if you look
at with the genetically modified crop whichis our people have now started using then
time may come if they will terminate theirpropagation with the market forces Then you
will sow those seeds but you won’t get theseeds which can be germinated you know then
what will happen You know the people willcontrol these market forces other business
people and we do not have a control over thatnature and they will do in a lab and we do
not know what they will be doing changing
So therefore nature is important nature shoulddo so lot of things are there that are being
what you call we need to preserve it and weneed to keep and I am not saying that we should
not understand the process of keeping theseeds and also the improving its quality There
is a various ways of enhancing Indian or maybe other countries also it is not only India
we are having the technologies but other peopleare having also but our technology will be
more akin to the our place because of variousreasons also the season
Now days the season is changing because ofwhat do you call global warming and climate
change Now how to go about it because if Iuse the ancient thing now it is difficult
to really do you will have to do you knowresearch and find out whether those old things
whether they will be applicable today or notright for that research has to be done taking
the clue from the ancient scriptures and otherthings we cannot apply just copy and from
the old thing and put today It is not possibleso we will have to do that
So Harrow used for preparing the seed bedafter ploughing and for covering the seeds
after sowing right So this is the very importantthing so which need to be done and it is also
used for breaking of soil crust crust youknow some lump of soil will be there and also
for uprooting weeds There will be some lotof weeds will be there so you need to remove
them because that will be taking the manurefrom the land Of course people say that weeds
will be better we will be talking about inter-croppingand that kind of things which we can do intelligently
it will be enriching each other right insteadof creating a problem you know
So that we will be talking little bit I willbe giving some flavour if not because that
is a big topic So if you look at soil crustit can be physically it can be biologically
Biological crust is basically a leaving communityof leaching and cyanobacteria algae moss growing
on the soil surface See there is lot of microorganismsare there and which will be helping to grow
the plants and the because it will actingas fertilizers and we are by giving pesticide
insecticide we are spoiling them u know Thenwe give fertilizer artificially what we are
doing is not the right thing
And as I told on the surface and that bindthe soil together because these are there
therefore it is binding it bring (())(24:11)that is to be broken If precipitated chemical
crust can develop the soil with the with highsoil connect because there will be some soil
which will be having salt content So thereforethat may be crust and that has to be also
broken but without spoiling this you knowwhat is the humus which is created by this
microorganism and other things right whichwill be decomposing the plants which will
there
And the blade of harrow this is the harrowwhich I have shown here is a blade harrow
right 21.75 inch long and 3.125 inch widthwith the two vertical tanks one on each and
fixed onto the flat wooden plank This is thewooden plank was found in Sanchi you might
be knowing in Bihar right And there are severalother things also people have found out and
if you look at this is the typical which Ihave shown harrow which is being used and
this is a handle one is handle like this ifyou look at is a handle and this of course
will be having a hand which will be you knowyou will have to press little bit
So that it is similar to that plough Hastatanuright this is the handle and this is what
you call the wooden plank this is this portionright this portion is basically wooden plank
right this number two and this wooden pegthese are the pegs three is the wooden peg
this is the wooden peg right and this pegthis will be made of basically even iron it
is not only wood iron can be used and thisfourth one is a Bamboo pole
So you will find several of them like Kotisain Amarakosa Amarkosa means it is a lot of
words together put it together in earliertext and Biddhaka in Krisiparasar verse number
118 consist of 9 cubic long and 21 spikesthere are several of them of course the other
one what we got as an evidence of ancienttime this is 2 but this is having 21 that
is what people are saying
And Leveller it is made of wood and bamboosticks Extra weight is added to all types
of planks by placing stones on it or havingperson ride on it like you might have seen
that people are riding For example this isa plank it won't level the soil there is a
broken now you will have to level So theseare the planks and this is the again handle
like kind of things handle will be here andthese are bamboo poles which will there can
be tied and which will be of course the woodenplank this one and it will be dragged by the
bull
So that I will show you and I have shown youearlier also the figure right and there is
another one which is a simpler one If youremember I had shown you a picture where this
having a wooden plank and that is nothingbut a leveller so we with this I would stop
over here and in the next lecture we willbe discussing about various other aspects
of agriculture Thank you very much
