We will start this lecture with a though processthat is the idle mind rust away like an unused
iron If you recall in the last lecture wediscussed about various applications and artefacts
which were you know being used earlier daysin ancient India And that shows very clearly
that Indians were knowing how to make theseproducts and also we discussed how they were
smiting the iron or producing the iron AndI argued that Uhh there are several varieties
of or there are several kinds of iron smeltingfurnaces across the country and people were
using their creativity and innovative ideasto implement them and which cannot be done
in the modern blast furnace So today we willbe discussing about the iron and steel crafts
in ancient India
We will have to use basically blacksmithingprocesses for making a product out of iron
And this process is basically carried outin such a way that metal becomes soft for
this purpose the rot iron is to be heateduntil the metal becomes very soft enough for
shaping with hand tools such as hammer anvilchisel etc of course there are several tools
one can use which are I have shown here Theseare blacksmith tools like hammers and of course
these hammers can be very small one can bebig one even people use very big hammers for
giving force
Chisels punchers hard hardy tools and tongsof course these are tongs I have shown fullers
and flatters And of course there is a controversywhether the stone anvil was there or iron
anvil but anvil was there in ancient IndiaAnd these pictures of course I have taken
from the recent one But there are some figuresfrom ancient excavations which are not good
That is why I have not included it And bythis blacksmithing process several products
namely light fixtures furnitures sculpturestools agriculture equipments religious items
cooking utensils and weapons and others werebeing produced in ancient India
The blacksmithing techniques can be broadlydivided into four categories One is forging
which is also known as sculpting Welding andearlier days the welding basically forge welding
was there in ancient India And of course theheat treatments I will be discussing about
the heat treatment methods and finishing Sowhat do you mean my forging The forging is
a process by which the blacksmith shapes themetal to a desired shape and size for making
it a useful product and for that purpose
Of course one has to heat the metal so thatit will be soft and then only you can apply
the force in a proper way using sometimesdie and other things so that it will take
the shape whatever you want to have For thatof course the basic forging operations can
be divided into various kinds like lengthening
Basically what you will have to do lengtheningmeans you are increasing the length of the
metal when you apply the force in a properway in one directional way such that the length
will be increasing of course it will be thinningdown the cross section will be decreasing
And there is another way of shrinking thatmeans if you compress it it may decrease its
size length and then it will be shrink thenyou can bend it that is known as bending and
upsetting and swaging Swaging is basicallyyou put into a proper dies and forge it so
that it will take the shape fuller uses thedies basically
And of course there is punching mark you wantto have then you apply some tool and then
apply the force using hammer And the lastbut not the lease the forge welding that means
you take two metals when they are hot andthen you apply the force so that it can be
joined together that is forge welding So ifyou look at these are the things which are
were being used in ancient India and ancientindian black smiths were having considerable
knowledge about various thermo mechanicaltreatments like forging and forge welding
heat treatments and others So we will be discussingabout the heat treatment process
Heat treatment process can be broadly dividedinto basically for the bulk material and also
for finishing the surface So for handlingthe bulk material so what it can be done that
you know one process is being cried out isknown as annealing the other process is normalising
Generally the normalising is carried out bycooling it in the air itself and hardening
and tempering in this process the coolingis cried out using water or oil and surface
finishing is done by the thermal process andthermo chemicals because you use some chemicals
and also apply some what you call heat andthen you can get a good surface
And during this heat treatment process basicallythe physical and sometimes the chemical properties
of material get changed And so that you needto play with that and get hardness sometimes
you know like malleable and other things sothat you can provide a proper shape to the
metal So this figure I have shown here isbasically temperature and this is the composition
and particular indicating the carbon in theiron If you look at there is a process of
course this is a constant temperature around700 maybe 27 kind of degree Celsius and the
annealing process full annealing occurs ata various temperature for different carbon
content so also the normalising and also thespheroidising.
Let us look at what do you mean by this annealingFor annealing of iron it is to be heated to
a high temperature then it is to be cooledvery slowly to the room temperature almost
room temperature As a result this micro structurewill possess high ductility and toughness
but low hardness and this is has to be doneproperly so that you will get this thing And
but whereas for normalising process the ironis to be heated and it has to be kept at high
temperature for a longer period of time Andthen of course it will be cooled slowly in
the air environment such that the rate ofcooling will be lower or it will be lower
as compared to when you are cooling with wateror using oil
So as a result the micro structure will bechanged and generally a mixture of ferrite
and cementite which will be in a layer bylayer that is known as pearlite and being
formed And as a result there will be you knowincrease in higher strength and hardness of
the metal but with a lower ductility So thisis basically normalising during this hardening
process iron is heated and kept at a propertemperature until all the pearlite is converted
into austenite and then it will be quenchedusing the oil and water any one of them so
that it will be cooling rapidlyAnd then there will be of course the micro
structures will be changing and then you willbe getting some kind of structures so that
it will be what you call very hard And duringall these three processes the temperature
and the heating time should be maintainedproperly of course which will be dependent
on the percentage of carbon in the iron Uhhso that higher level of austenite can be obtained
and the microstructure of the hardened steelconsist of ferrite martensite and cementite
also
But if you look at it is an art and whichhas to be done really without getting into
the detail of microstructures because youneed to have an idea about that what is happening
And of course this comes from the experienceand also certain procedures So I will just
talk about little bit about ferric and carbonphase diagram because we talked about various
phases and then various structures micro structuresUhh If you look at here at a very high temperature
it will be liquid and then of course in thiszone there will be some kind of structure
which we do not have much interest in thatfor so far heat treatment is concerned
But heat treatment is basically if you lookat in this temperature is shown and in this
the percentage of carbon if you look at thisthis is the steel is something around 0.02
to 2.17 percentage of carbon is known as steeland then this point 0.76 percent of carbon
or the hypo Eutectoid and beyond this is hyperEutectoid zone and of course for 2.17 to 6.7
percent is known as cast iron
If you look at this is corresponds to A1 wherehere it will be ferrite structure will be
there which is you know like a very soft innature as compared to other micro structures
but as you keep this temperature between something727 degree and then this region there will
be alpha and gama austenite here will be Gamaaustenite and in this region of course there
will be what you called pearlite and feriteand pearlite and cementite in this region
course this is cementite region
But what is being done during the hardeningis that you know you put here austenite and
then you will be cooling it And when it iscooling the things you will be getting basically
pearlite and ferrite kind of structure andthis is occurring during basically annealing
process But whereas as it is cooled very rapidlyin case of hardening it will be an austenite
but it will be coming suddenly to pearliteand cementite which will be very hard So if
you look at these are the structures whichwill be you know we try to maintain because
of that there is hardness and softness andductility all those will be maintained
And I was talking about pearlites Peariliteis basically these are lamella statures and
this will be ferrite and cementite and particularlywhen it is hardening this Uhh what you call
these will be converted to Uhh what you callmore cementite structure kind of things And
the gap between these things will depend onthe temperature and the rate of cooling but
if you look at ancient metallurgist particularlyin India they were not aware about all these
you know structures
What they were knowing is a very know yourhands-on experience and they were knowing
how to achieve final hardness by varying youknow various charactertics particularly one
is carbon content of the iron and extent ofcross sectional thickness of the object because
if you look at like the rate of cooling willbe dependent on the cross section of the object
and the also how much time it will be givingfor soaking Generally the rule is that if
it is 25 mm you will have to go for at leastone hour But in principle people go for at
least 2 hours for soaking at a high temperature
And final temperature of the object from whichit is quenched that also they look at the
temperature At that time there were not anyinstrument to measure but they will have a
visual observation from that they will betrying to guess what will be the temperature
and then they will do that And of course theseverity of cooling during the quenching they
will go for air cooling or water cooling orfor oil cooling kind of thing and control
of the phase transform proper heat treatmentthey were just by guessing they were doing
because of hands-on experience
And even today also you will not see thinkthat I will measure they will be doing particularly
the art the artist and in the rural area eventoday they know what is to be done They may
not be knowing all these what you call FECphase diagram kind of thing but they were
knowing what is to be done
Let us now discuss about iron pillar whichis rustless And if you look at this is the
pillar which I have shown here which is locatedcurrently in the Qutub Minar You can note
one thing that this is having an increasingdiameter and it is being measured by various
researchers and some of them have just putit here and this is having a decorative portion
of this rustless iron pillar this amountsto be 60 units U is basically related to one
Angula or inch And if you look at it is thediameter of this iron pillar is 12 U here
whereas at this zone it is something 16 Uand in this portion 24 U and again it comes
back to 24 this is below the ground you knowearlier days the original burial level here
but now it has been gone to this portion
And there is a platform below you know whichsupports this iron pillar And similarly the
length of this what you call portion whichis 40 U what is existing today but people
are thinking there was some emblem here (be)above it and that is why they are thinking
of 60 Unit if you put that thing And fromthis region this region it is something 180
U and this is 60 U from its when it is increasingits diameter and having a very good nice curve
to it And it if you look at it is like a cantileverI mean they were knowing this has to be more
so that it can support the thing So 18 U isthis one this portion and this is 18 U these
dimensions right
And of course it is being claimed by severalauthors that ancient measurement system was
adopted by British system but it is questionableand one has to do more research to find out
whether it is true or not or maybe it is justa false claim So from this you can note that
you know dimensionally they were maintainingthe object what they were producing But maintaining
a dimensional tolerance is not that easy eventoday So let us see how they might have created
this rust less iron pillar which is considerto be one of the wonders in the entire world
And Uhh this is again what I am showing hereis basically hypothetical there is no evidence
how they made it But people are thinking howthey might have made this way This is a pedestal
they will be making continuously of coursethis is a staircase right through which people
will be going to the top and they will beusing some iron This says the iron which is
hot iron pieces and they used Uhh what youcall bellows which is basically bellows and
this is a tong which will be they will beholding this piece of iron they will heat
it and take it from here to this region andthen place properly and again they will be
heating these are all what you call heatersor Uhh heating furnace you can say right
And they will be applying this force by withthe help of a big hammer in a continuous manner
so that it will be forged well with that Thisis known as hand held hammers you know and
this is vertical forging technique this isbasically vertical forging technique what
people are thinking they might have done Butnobody knows how they did it So that is even
with this people are anticipating insteadof what you call hand held hammer which is
having limitations they might be using hammeringrod which a pulley and you know rope systems
And again the some process they will be doinglike they will be heating this iron looms
and then they will take this and place thisand they will go on hammering so that it will
be welded And if you look at as this heightof this pillar goes on increasing there will
be increase in this pedestal it is a verypainstaking job if you look at that way
Whether they did in this way or they haveused some other way like another way one can
think of is horizontal method that is horizontalforging technique They will be using a peg
here and this is your iron pillar to startwith the peg which will that will be easy
to rotate they will be rotating this way Andthen there will be there is a furnace here
and of course handling clap they will be fixinghere
And then what will they will put in a dieor an anvil and they will take this iron lump
which is heated one and they go on you knowhammering into the proper size and then they
will also rotate this one this one in whatyou call a continuous manner and putting this
iron lump and so that they could have producedthis And as I told this is a hypothetical
because they will have to lift up and thendown and rotate it you know this thing and
there is of course similar way
Instead of using hammer what they will bedoing is that they will be using a hammering
log of made of maybe iron with hardness hardnessiron plate they might have fixed Of course
this can be wood if they are thinking it willbe wood timber and they will be having an
iron plate they could have joint it and thenhammer it so that it will be making this is
basically Uhh iron lump And right and thisdie will give this shape because die should
be hardened otherwise die will get you knowspoiled in the process Of course in this case
it will be horizontal force which will beacting due to the moment of this log wood
log and also with the iron plate But theymight have made this way So these are the
hypothetically people are thinking that theymight have made in this way
Uhh There is a possible use of dies for examplethere will be a die block and they will be
heating it and then iron pan cake they willput it here and then hammer it by the force
or they will be using a hammering log Uhhwhich I had described just now And there is
another way of that you know the similar waythat is the pillar and then this is a die
block and die block can be put together andthey will be rotating it and support it will
be and then hammer from this side and so thatthey will be making the forge welding operation
to take place Of course for these purposesone can use what you can this is when it is
a vertical pillar making and they will beusing the charcoal this generally the wooden
charcoal right They will be using and bellowsfor the supplying the air you know air will
be coming out of this and of course this isfor the horizontal pillar making process
So by this people might have done and onecan see that like how it is Of course lot
of other research are going on I am just showingsome of them due to paucity of time Lot of
work has been carried out on this archeo-metallurgyof the iron in India And this data is corresponding
to ultrasound measurements what they are doingis they are putting a transmitter right and
which can produce this ultra sound and thenyou will be pouting this receiver at each
point and then find out how this intensitygoing on what is the speed velocity at which
the sound is propagating
And at different location they have takenthey have taken in what you call 41.1 centimetre
and then you know like at this diameter thisis 1 meter 2 meter 3 meter 4 meter 5 meter
height corresponding to different diameterwhich is shown here 41.1 and then 38.2 at
different like this is if you look at thisis your A B and this is your C and D and E
so and these corresponding to the sound andfrom these they could you know find out that
there is a places right
Uhh that side way addition of iron metal inthe main pillar lying horizontal position
They are thinking that you know these lumpsof thing are being placed in the side as a
result what will happen these velocity isnot symmetric right if is changing Because
of there is obstruction there will be metalsurface which will be still lying there is
two metal lumps having a surface so that itwill not allow the sound to come it will be
reflecting back
As a result from this they are saying thatUhh in ancient India this iron pillar could
have been made in a horizontal position andthat is a conclusion they are making because
these are different in some cases for examplehere it is very clear this sound is very different
than this where this is 6000 meter per secondand this is basically if you look at that
is 4500 to 5000 meter per second
So that is the conclusion they have made fromthis measurement and as I told you the decorative
bell capital if you look at the dimensionsare given in terms of U you know it has like
various complicated looks to very complicatedand having this thing If you look at this
bell shape this is like inverted Kalash kindof thing and that is one third B B is basically
corresponding to 16 U and this is also B rightone fourth B And how they are maintaining
these curves you know and then what are thethese dimensions these are the big question
which is coming to our mind And actual figureit shows these are of course the diagram drawing
of this actual figures and it looks too verybeautiful
And Uhh a question might be coming to mindwhy they have made so you know attractive
and decorative in nature One interpretationis that this is basically a this portion this
portion having a punya Kalash and it is abowl of plenty And we know that you know always
Indians were very much interested to havethe ultimate goal of life of attaining spiritual
hood that is attaining the perfection andwhat we say is that Punyam idem (pun) Punyamadath
punyamudachyathe punyashya punya mathaya punyamevamashishate That means you will have to
attain the perfection that is the ultimateobjective of life and this is being placed
in front of a temple
So therefore people will be coming and tryingto you know look at themselves and then go
back and then walk for this attaining theperfection which is the ultimate objective
of life so far the Indian philosophy is concernedAnd it is not only here it is all our auspicious
occasions there will be a pot which will befilled with water and that also indicates
or gives a signal to us that we will haveto attain this perfection in as a human being
So of course this portion of Garuda whichis being shown here is not there and but people
are thinking that Garuda shape might be herewhich has been removed from the original structure
and might be again the Vishnu will be therehere And people are also telling that this
there might be another one like you know thisis nakshatra chakra which was having giving
some idea about various nakshatra And somepeople are interpreting that there might be
sudarshana chakra which is being generallybeing used by lord Vishnu And these are being
basically made of maybe copper during theSamudragupta period because how they are anticipating
it they are taking this idea basically froma copper coin which was being invoked during
the Samudragupta period that might be thething but how they made this thing of course
they are thinking that it will be made ofnot iron but maybe some other bronze or some
other metal
And let us look at this multi sided circulardisc which is having 20 disks sided disk in
the upper one If you look at this is one ofthem right and how they are making this thing
that is one thing and of course they are making16 sided circular disk why this change one
can think of I mean like these are all mysteryone has to research and find out why it is
And this is the reeded slanted section thisportion is the slanted section how they have
made and there is another section comes thebell shaped inverted Kalash shaped thing how
they have made out of this is the one questionmight be coming into picture
And this is the thing what I was taking aboutThese are the 20 faces and these are 16 faces
and these are slanted one And this is theyour bell shaped what you call inverted Kalash
like bowl inverted bowl or inverted Kalashyou can call Now how they have manufactured
these things this is one question might becoming to your mind A lot of hypothesis being
made what I will be discussing is hypotheticalbecause there is no evidence there is nothing
written that how they have made about it Soone of them what one can think of that you
know these are the shape I have just magnifiedit here
If you look at these are rod right it willbe having a rod kind of things these are all
iron rods okay And they might have tone ironrod here in rod and then bend it and put it
here right If you look at like this is therod what they have taken and they have also
flattened and made this curve little bit Inbetween there is a one single rod this is
the bend rod right and this is the singlerod they have made and then forge welded to
this portion that might be the one way Buthow they were maintaining the tolerance of
the rod diameter is one question might becoming and also besides this they were making
little flattened.
If you look at this portion you know thisportion is little more diameter than inner
one and flattened also they make a curvedone what shape they will be using how they
are maintaining this and managing the shapesis also one question coming to my mind And
these are the things one has to do that maybesomebody should replicate And what mind and
concentration power and judgement power thosepeople will be having who had made this thing
So Uhh let us look at how they and there isa thing whether they have made this in a single
piece or they have made each pieces and thenassembled them together that is one question
coming to mind But what people are thinkingthat there might be use some different pieces
they might have manufactured and then likethis you know this is the inverted Kalash
and this is the ring and these are the allring kind of things and they have fitted
Now of course there is a decrease in diameterif you look at this is diameter 5 and then
5.1 and then this is 5.2 and 5.2 is greaterthan 5.1 diameter and then of course you know
it will be easier for them to put togetherSo that is one way of by pressure they will
be using it and then you know but then howthey will be matching this diameter so that
why it will not go here and there you knowlike that is one There is another way of people
are anticipating they will be using a hollowcylinder here this is the hollow cylinder
right and they will be putting these individualcomponents on this what you call hollow cylinder
with thin wall thickness And then they willbe putting this inside and they will be hammering
it using the force Right as a result it willbe shrink fitting kind of things that is another
way
But which is the correct one and how theydid all those things has to be you know studied
and then one can look at But even if you considerthis thing that itself shows that what is
the craftsmen they were having and what isthe technology that they were having during
that at that time So therefore it is veryimportant to Uhh you now appreciate their
skills of making this not only the iron pillarbut several of them but I am discussing iron
pillar now And then why question arises iswhy is the Iron pillar rustless
That is the question might be coming of courselot of research has been done on this but
there is lot of diverse kind of opinion beingmade by various researchers I will be discussing
about something which is very simpler beingexplained by the late professor balasubrahmanyam
of IIT Kanpur and I have taken this thingfrom his book on iron pillar
So let us consider a metal mild steel whichwill be having of course no other like chromium
nickel and other things As a result what willhappen whenever it will be coming in contact
with Uhh the atmospheric air oxygen and particularlyand also the moisture then what will happen
several oxy hydroxides will be forming likelet us say gama FeOOH and because this iron
will be containing Fe iron and also the Hand O it will be there in this compound And
then these you know creates something likea discontinuous layer near the metal like
if you look at the one layer and this alsothere is another kind of Uhh alpha FeOOH being
formed sometimes because with time this gamaFeOOH is converted into FeOOH which is known
as Geothite
And this gama FeOOH crystalline structureis known as also lepidocrocite Uhh and this
being what happen like there will be a crackin between and which will allow this oxygen
and the water to come in contact with themetal As a result the rusting will be occurring
because oxide will be formed and then rustingwill be occurring and this as a result rusting
cannot be prevented by this But of coursein the modern time people do add copper chromium
nickel of course chromium nickel are beingused nowadays very much and of course some
people have started adding phosphorous ina small quantities
And this creates a delta oxyhydro oxides layersamorphous which is amorphous in nature And
this will be acting as a protective layerbetween the what you call the atmosphere and
the metal virgin metal Of course on the topof this delta FeOOH layer there will be alpha
FeOOH and Gama FeOOH there might be crackin between but however they will be amorphous
in nature therefore it will not be any crackAnd it will act as a protective layer so that
we will get rust less iron like stainlesssteel iron and other things
But in ancient times that what people areusing in Delhi Iron pillar particularly they
were using the metal containing a lot of phosphoruscertain amount of phosphorus The good thing
about this that it will be reacting with thewater and also the oxygen when it is exposed
to the atmosphere in the beginning of coursethere will be some amorphous delta Fe layer
will be there there is might be crack theremight be little rusting will be there maybe
But as the time progresses this layer theprotective layer the iron hydrogen phosphate
hydrate layer which will be thickened andthen it will be very protective
With respect to time you know time means nothours or days it will be years together and
these became more rust less and that is beingoccurred due to the alternative wetting and
drying condition because you know in the rainingseason it will be lot of moisture will be
there in the winter season you know moisturewill not be there in the air so therefore
that will be going on
And that helps in building this iron hydrogenphosphate hydrate and also its thickness increases
as a result you will get rustless iron withthe time you know So generally it is other
way if you keep the steel for longer stainlesssteel particularly for longer period rusting
will be occurring But in this case that willnot occur it is just opposite of that
So therefore Uhh with this I will concludethat iron is the part and parcel of Indian
civilisation and modern iron steel makingis quite costing and environmentally unfriendly
as I had discussed in earlier lecture Andolden days technology is quite small in scale
which can be adopted by semi-skilled peopleand thus generate employment and least pollution
as distributed across larger area and peoplecan innovate on it And Uhh because there is
a lot of scope for people to carry out youknow innovative research and implement very
easily in this older iron making furnace
And corrosion resistant irons used in ironpillars can be adapted easily skill possessed
by the people not by the machine or the whatyou call very few Uhh people companies make
our people to realise their potential whiledevelope developing excellence in life So
more research work on the understanding andreviving this old technology for making iron
must be carried out in future It is not thatonly for iron will be Uhh you know doing research
we will be doing also to revive old technologymaybe in a little modern sense so that it
can be accepted by the people Thank you verymuch
