Let us start this lecture with a thought processfrom Mahatma Gandhi ‘It is health that is
real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver’In the last lecture we were discussing about
how our ancestors were Uhh you know manufacturingthe gold and kind of things And we are discussing
about Kolar gold mine and if you look at inIndia Basically three forms of gold can be
found
One is alluvial sedimentary deposit at a shallowdepth in the river basin In Nilgiris of Tamil
Nadu there have been some deposit which weredig upto the depth of 25 metre or more And
beside this; of course there are Uhh somesands of several rivers like Sindh Sutlaj
Ganges Swarna Rekha and others which containsthe fine particles of gold So beside this
the metal nuggets and streaks are found inquartz veins at Kolar and Hattii gold mines
Karnataka Uhh if you recall the Karnatakawas Uhh one of the oldest gold mine in the
entire world
Here I am showing you two parts of a singlegold coin which was during the Vasu Deva I
around 191 to 230 CE On the left hand sideyou can see that a king is standing and which
is Uhh sacrificing the things in altar hereThis is the altar kind of things and it is
having a Trident here And the resting on theleft-hand on the sceptre which is generally
being used as a symbol of Uhh you know powerby the King It is basically Uhh kind of a
stick which was Uhh used earlier days by kings
And second Trident this image is basi Correspondingto the Shiva because it was having bull Nandi
is there on here It is having also a Tridentso therefore this corresponding to Shiva So
this was the gold and beside this there areUhh several gold jewelleries were found in
various parts and Uhh we always feel thatIndian jewelry is as old as Indian civilisation
itself And you will find lot of evidencesin the sculptures in the temple of Orissa
South India Sanchi Amravati and several Uhhalso Ajanta paintings and several places
And these jewelleries were being used by commonman king and even men women and other things
Let us look at how they were separating thegold and this method Uhh is being used even
today in some remote areas of India That isgravity separation or some people call it
panning Why because they use a pan and asshown in this figure what they will be taking
this quartz rock or the hard solid first isto be crashed into fine particles and then
of course the oversized particles can be screenedout and put into a pan
This of course you can use in you know waterPour the water into this pan and then agitate
it so that you know suspended particles whichare later will be going out with the water
And some of the other particles which arelighter than the gold itself will be remaining
here on the bottom There is a heavy materiallike gold which will be remaining here and
this you call we call gangue which is a uselessore and Uhh not a much importance
Basically the gold particles settled downat the bottom of the pan and the sand and
soils and other which you call as the gangueare to be washed away After this you know
you obtain these gold particles it can beseparated very easily from the gangue and
it is to be sold to the Goldsmith or Uhh meltingrefining or shaping of the metal So this you
can see this process looks to you quite simpleand people do use even Uhh today across the
country
Particularly the poor people use this methodThere are Uhh various technology people have
used to make jewelleries and various itemsthese items I have shown some of them which
were in ancient India Of course nowadays peopleare using These are the gold ornaments were
being designed and developed by in an ancientIndia Pure gold Uhh melts around 1063 degree
Celsius kind of things for that you need tohave a furnace As I told earlier the gold
particles of by panning method was meltedin a crucible refined by addition of fluxed
like Borax which is basically sodium borateor sodium tetra borate And this flux basically
will be in Uhh ratio of 6 is to 1 is to 3corresponding to the mixture of ammonium chloride
and borax and ammonium nitrate
And this is basically used so that the slagand other thing can be flowed out very easily
so that the gold can be purified further Thereis another method of separation of silver
from gold was being used in ancient Indiawhich is known as Niyaria The person who will
be doing the separation of gold and silverwas known as Niyaria There is a another techniques
which is used to form the gold particles orthe gold spheres that is known as granulation
technique which was in vogue in around thelate first millennium BC in India
I will just show you a picture which Uhh wastaken during the British time of a Goldsmith
was working in this painting around 1856 thisUhh painting was made If you can see from
here the artisan is Uhh on the left side thisside is using blower tube to introduce more
amount of oxygen so that temperature willbe going around maybe 1000 degree Celsius
Uhh such that he can make the gold and alsowork with Uhh you know it
Of course beside this there are several otherprocesses being done for zinc and then embossing
kind of thing which we will be discussingSo the purified metal bar was basically made
by forging punching or embossing etc for producingvarious ornaments having intricate designs
If you look at Uhh beside this gold coinswere made by die casting in clay moulds or
by the technique of punch marking
Embossing if you look at is a process of metalworkin which localised forces are to be used such
that metal can flow depending on the designwhich will be there on the projection of a
die In this picture the artist with the helpof a hammer and a tool is trying to emboss
the plate and the tool is having a dye whichis on the bottom not shown in this figure
which is being used for making this designthat embossing design which is shown here
And this is a beautiful pitcher which hasbeen embossed by the artist and which needs
a lot of patience and also very good perseverancefor to do that and also the skill The forging
the method of metal work that is being usedto apply the force in a such that lateral
flow of material is not restricted by thetool or the die I will just show you that
what is being done is an anvil right wherea gold ring is being made by the hammering
it by Uhh using the basically forging andthose are the marks of hammering as shown
here kind of things And this will be verydelicate work one has to do and they have
a control over the force being applied bythe artist
Let us look at little bit history the oldTestament indicates that the Ophir which is
a port town Uhh mention about export of silverand gold from India Of course this Ophir town
is basically a mystic town which is Uhh notknown where it is located Some people claim
it is to be located in South India some peopleclaim is to be located in Gujarat Some people
located in Uhh you know in some other countrieslike Greek or in the Africa So therefore it
is not really very much known however theMegasthenes who visited India around 350 to
290 BC has Uhh mentioned about the miningof the golds in various parts of India in
the Neolithic to Chalcolithic and Megalithicperiods
And Uhh during the period of Ashokan Empireits capital was also known as Swarnnagari
and it is known for the golden Splendour Sofrom this evidence one can see that the gold
were being used in ancient India also stillwe are fond of gold
Uhh Let us now look at Silver because silverand lead always talked about it as it is you
know Uhh together As the gold is related tothe sun the Sanskrit word Jval to shine the
brilliant white metal silver has been relatedto moon earlier it was also called Luna And
silver nitrate is still called the lunar causticSo Uhh the silver melting point is around
962 degree Celsius It has been found to occurin natural form like chlorargyrite basically
the mineral form of silver chloride whichI have shown here Uhh an ore here of silver
chloride argentite which is a silver sulphideassociated with the Galena and Uhh Sphalerite
which is either it can be zinc sulphide orthe ferric sulphide kind of things is a mixed
sulphide ores
This extraction of this kind of ores is saidto be started in India around 3rd to 4th millennium
BCE with the development of techniques totreat the sulphide mineral particularly the
roasting and reduction method And this isthe Argentite what I have shown this Uhh you
know from this colour one can make out thatis a silver sulphide And during extraction
of lead from the lead sulphide or the leadoxide the silver sulphide also gets decomposed
and reduced easily at around 470 degree CelsiusAnd the problem with that it readily alloys
with you know this metal at around 1000 degreeCelsius
So therefore that is the reason why the metallurgyof lead is being describe along with the silver
Note that lead is one of softest and heaviestmetal having shining grey lustre which leaves
a black streak on the paper and it is usedmostly for making cheap jewelleries dies/pattern
mixed with copper to harden it The lead artifactshave been reported from the Harappan period
but unfortunately it was not being used verymuch during that period due to its softness
But later on people started using it and inSouth India the lead coins have been used
in 1st to 2nd century BCE and it was the chiefcoinage metal for considerable time
And the reactions occuring during the roastingof Galena if you look at it will be Two moles
of Lead sulphide is reacting with Three molesof Oxygen going to the two moles of lead oxide
and sulphur dioxide And this again lead sulphideand lead oxide will be reacting It will be
going to the lead and sulphur dioxide Andadditionally lead oxide can be reduced by
the carbon at 500 degree Celsius or even thecarbon monoxide which maybe formed during
this Uhh process can also react with leadoxide giving the lead and carbon dioxide
During this process what happens the Uhh liquidlead alloys with the silver easily Hence it
was Uhh you know first to be produced thisalloy by co-reduction of lead and silver minerals
Then the pure silver is to be produced bythe process of cupellation As I told earlier
the cupellation process was also known duringthe harappan period Of course we used the
galena in indian subcontinent which is foundin rajasthan at zarwar In small towns in Kashmir
Gharble in Uttar Pradesh Bihar and Kerala
One of the biggest deposits of galena andsilver sulphide is found at Burma and you
people might be knowing that Burma is oneof the major silver producer even today Let
us look at how you know lead and silver canbe separated The process used in ancient india
particularly Zarwar of Rajasthan was mostprobably the ore hearth furnace which I have
shown here and this is the schematic of aore hearth furnace and where the roasting
and reduction of rich galena is carried outin an open hearth pit furnace
This is a open hearth pit furnace and Uhhif you look at it is having the stone walls
here and Uhh there is a faggots and peat Peatbasically you can say kind of a coal or the
charcoal and the ore together It is beingplaced in this layer by layer And then it
has to be of course generally being placedin a hilly regions such that you will get
a you know this melted lead can be collectedin this pit
They Uhh choose that place suitably so thatslope will be there And this is of course
a cross section which is being taken herethese are the stone walls right this are the
stone walls And it will be in such furnacethe temperature around 100 degree Celsius
can be obtained easily because of naturaldraft and the metal gets reduced and flowed
because of slope will be there and then itis collected in a pit
As I told earlier the silver metal was obtainedby alloy of lead and silver by reheating it
in a shallow hearth furnace this is a hearthfurnace having the bottom prepared with the
bone charcoals See what will happen this meltedthings will be coming over here and this will
be aligned with the bones charcoals such thatUhh you know cupellation method can be utilised
to separate the silver
At this high temperature the silver sulphidealso get decomposed and forms an alloy with
the molten metal And during remelting of alloyit is subject to oxidising condition by blowing
excess air when the lead gets preferentiallyoxidised to PbO which you call it as a litharge
because it has a very low melting point Themolten litharge is skimmed off and partially
absorbed by the furnace hearth
As I told there is a bone charcoal which willbe there and that will be absorbing this litharge
or the lead oxide so that it will be separatedeasily And this process is basically known
as cupellation
So cupellation if you look at is a refiningprocess in metallurgy where ores are treated
under high temperature have control operationto separate noble metal like gold silver or
any other metal from the base metal like leadcopper zinc and others present in the ore
The cupel which I have shown here is Uhh basicallya small vessel shaped in the form of inverted
cone because if you look at this like a invertedtruncated cone because if you look at this
is like a inverted truncated cone made outof bone ash like this generally you know surfaces
inner surfaces will be having bone ashes whichare used for the small scale cupellation for
processing gold and silver in ancient india
Of course nowadays in modern time it is havingproper dimensions you know like which I have
shown here like D1 and this is the total Dand there is certain thickness and you know
like height is maintained and this are theplace where the metal will be kept And according
to Kautilya’s Arthasastra detan about thecupellation for purification of silver is
given He has mentioned in this way The impuresilver maybe heated four times with the copper
sulphate (Suskatutha) and mixed with powderbone that is asthitutha and again four times
with equal quantity of lead and again fourtimes with the copper sulphate games three
times in a skull and lastly twice with a cowdung And by this process the silver is purified
He has mentioned that That means it very clearlystate that the skull will be having the bone
itself you know and then that will be nothingbut your acting like a you know separating
the metal by the cupellation process
So it clearly indicates that this processwas being used in ancient India the cupellation
method And there are also the evidences ofcrucibles found in different sites of India
like if you look at this one to two he Terracottain Lothal regions and Uhh of course the three
also the stone in the Lothal region four tofive Terracotta in Ahar in UP 6 to 7 is the
Uhh the Atranjikhera that is 6 to 7 this kindof cupel were found during excavations and
Rajghat is 8 to 9 kind of 11 to 16 in Uhhif you look at 11 12 13 14 like 16 are in
Taxila and seventeen twenty one in early historyof Uhh Bhokardan Uhh you know people found
That means you know if you look at this, thisevidence it is very clear that people were
using that cupel and also the crucibles formelting the silver and also the separating
the lead from out of it in ancient times SoUhh with this I will stop over here and we
will be discussing the next lecture aboutthe copper which is a part and parcel of Indian
life because of fat that it is related toour Uhh rituals Thank you very much
