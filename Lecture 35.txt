Let us start this lecture with the thoughtprocess from Rudyard Kipling who says ‘Gold
is for mistress - Silver for the maid Copperfor the craftsman cunning at his trade “Good”
said the Baron sitting in the hall “ButIron- Cold iron - is master of them all”.’
So this is a beautiful poem written by RudyardKipling who has talked about iron and which
is the master of all the metals that we havediscussed till now
We have discussed lot of Uhh you know metalsin ancient India which are being used and
today we will be discussing about iron makingin ancient India So a question might be coming
to your mind why is iron important for ourlife If you look at iron is one of the most
widely used metals Uhh accounting for around95 percent worldwide of metal production at
this moment And why it is being used veryprofusely because of fact that it is having
very low cost with high strength Thereforeit is being used profusely in engineering
applications even in our day to day life likeif you look at Al pin safety pin you know
nail hammer lot of other places we do usein our day to day life apart from the engineering
application
But engineering applications some of the examplesI am just giving you not all that is machinery
automobiles ships engineering components buildingmaterials and several of them So therefore
that is very important and if you look atin India we are having Uhh iron production
which is Uhh increasing you know this is theblue lines It is in million tons of course
2013 people are you know Uhh escalating itto higher you know level in the sense people
are thinking of something around maybe Uhhtwo seventy million tons per year they want
to produce and Uhh earlier days of courseiron ores were being exported but once we
started enhancing our production and alsoutilization in the local markets and then
naturally the oil exports Uhh over exportsiron over exports have been decreasing and
that is a good thing
Instead of selling this iron ores in a verylower value you can have a product add the
value to this iron and then you can sell itThat is the better way then what I remember
when I was a kid I am in Orissa like we wereselling this Uhh iron to japan iron ores to
Japan not iron Uhh at a throw away price Soit is good that we are doing and it is not
that Uhh currently Uhh you know iron beingused profusely but irons also were used in
ancient times
Let us look at the iron ore which is basicallya mixture of rocks and iron oxide predominantly
but some other metal impurities might be thereUhh it can Uhh have different colors like
dark grey bright yellow or deep purple torusty red and of course from this color one
can identify Uhh the iron ores different kinds
Uhh some of the Uhh iron ores which are availablein India are Magnetite Hematite Limonite and
Siderites But hematite is being predominantlyUhh you know available in our country which
is color is shown in this diagram you knowand which corresponding to basically rusty
red kind of things and Uhh of course the Magnetiteis little different than that it is having
more shining And Magnetite is the ore whichis the Uhh which can attract the iron because
it is having magnetic properties
So if you look at iron ore Uhh deposits youcan find various parts starting from the south
sides to all regions in the eastern side evenin the middle of India MP Uhh and even Maharashtra
and Gujarat and then even West Bengal Jharkhandand several area Most of the parts of India
except few places like Gangetic plains andthen Himalayan region you know like India
is having a large deposits which are scatteredaround across the country.
So let us look at now the Uhh how the ironwere being used in ancient India If you go
to Harappan period Uhh people could not findmuch use of iron However Uhh during Vedic
periods which span around something 1500 to500 BC and people were using iron for household
agriculture tools buildings and even toolsand iron and sword and daggers all those things
were Uhh basically made of iron at that time
And lot of evidence are being Uhh found outUhh that is the Lothal you might be remembering
Lothal which is located in Gujarat which isa part of Harappan civilization Ahar in UP
and Gufkral in the Kashmir valley Antranjikehrain UP Hallur In Karnataka Of course Hallur
in Karnataka around something 1000 BC peoplehave found out that iron being used and Tinnevelly
in south India around 550 BC.
Besides this you can find during this Mauryankingdom and after that Kanishka kind of things
Like Chandra Gupta Asoka and King Huvishkathat periods people were using Uhh the iron
made Uhh you know swords daggers agriculturetools coins clamps and several other things
they were using And Uhh during 1 to 100 CEiron spear heads nails of course apart from
the other things what has been described earlierlike swords daggers and coins and clamps Uhh
Their evidence is being found out and Piprahwain UP region And of course you people will
be very much aware about rust less iron pillarUhh which is located now in New Delhi earlier
it was there that belongs to something 500CE
And 600 1200 CE lot of iron being used invarious places but most remarkable is the
iron beams which were used in temples of KonarkPuri and Bhubaneshwar you will find and Uhh
of course after 1200 till 1800s apart fromother day to day Uhh you know equipments and
tools and then and other items the iron wereprofusely used for making iron guns and cannons
in a big way Those evidence has been foundin Tanjore Bijapur Muzaffar Nagar and several
other places which I will be discussing aboutthem some of them
Let us look at where people found these ironsand they Uhh in the left hand side it is shown
the various places and here it is the Uhhyears and this side is basically if you look
at this is CE and this side is BCE beforecommon era and after common era So if you
look at they got the iron Uhh in this as Itold Ahar Loebarn and other places and even
Atranjikhera and Noh in Sonpur there are severalplaces some of them I am just mentioning so
that you can keep in mind Hastinapur whichis a mythological city that is nearby New
Delhi and Kaushambi Rajghat Rupar and UjjainRaj Rajagiri Taxila and of course the Delhi
pillar and Konark beams like you can see
That means people started using around somethingmaybe you know Uhh 1300 BC or little bit more
because this is the era bar which is shownthat this can you know be from this for example
if I take about this thing then this willbe basically from 1400 to 1200 that range
it cannot be that exact
So Uhh that people have found out and thereis a clear evidence that Uhh Indians were
using irons profusely Uhh staring from somethingaround 1300 BC onwards And during Vedic period
you can Uhh look at the evidence in the Vedaslike Rig vedas and Atharva vedas and other
things like Uhh the word “Ayas” whichis known as iron basically Uhh is used in
several times you know in Rig Veda and otherVedas and the word “Ayodomastra” is basically
the iron tusk and “Ayojala” is iron nets
If you look at if this is the true then youknow like question here is how they are making
that iron nets and “Ayasnayena ankena”that is iron hooks were used in several places
in Atharva Veda and only we will considertwo shlokas just to look at how this iron
word is being used in this shloka from AtharvaVeda that is homage “Homage be to thee O
Nirrti thou of keen keenness; unfasten thebond-fetters of iron”
So if you look at Uhh that means they wereusing this iron therefore they will be knowing
the strong ness of the iron and Uhh if youlook at this is the Ayasnayena this is the
word which is corresponding to the iron “Thouwaste bound here it an iron post bridled with
deaths that are a thousand” and this isthis shloka is basically from Atharva Veda
also
And Uhh if you look at the earliest Iron Agesites in south India is located in Hallur
in Karnataka and Adichanallur in Tamilnaduwhich dates back to around 1000 BC And iron
in the epic periods if you look at which isUhh you know around something 500 BCE to 100
BCE Uhh I have taken a shloka from Mannu Smrutiand again this is Uhh Aya and Aya basically
means the iron and which says “Mani muktapravalana thamrasya rajatasya cha ayan kanstyopalana
cha dwadasan kana natha” So you can seethat even again iron even being used here
of course Uhh for this you know like peoplehave found out evidence Uhh by the from the
excavated items
And let us look at evidence of the iron usesin ancient India from Arthasastra by Chanakya
which is around 300 BCE And he has describedvarious weapons namely swords arrows sataghni
sataghni means killer of hundreds I do notknow how they were doing that and that is
one has to find out and axes plates breastplates armors etc which these items you know
he has mentioned in his text and which aremade of iron and this is being taken basically
Arthasastra by Chanakya edited by R Sham Shastri
This text not only talks about the uses ofirons also talked about how Uhh one can really
Uhh you know mine it and what has to be doneand there is a very clear cut that there is
a system of making you know Uhh training thepeople how to mine and also the Uhh manage
the mining process and other things
For example what the shloka I have taken fromR Sham Shastri from here This shloka indicates
like if you look at “Akara dakshya” meanssuperintendent of mines should make trial
borings with the help of trained men who arewell versed in the knowledge of metals That
means there was also training trained peopleat the time who must be used for Uhh making
a trial boring before mining and there isalso a superintendent of mines that what he
has talked about And he should be adept inthe examination of the precious metals
That means the superintendent of the mineswould have the knowledge about the Uhh you
know Uhh precious metals whether it is theright or wrong and he should be provided with
necessary apparatus make borings in thoseplaces where presence of slag charcoal ashes
and others indicating previous smelling smeltingoperations in those places either in the plains
or at the foot of mountains
And they were also can identify the placeof mining by the you know color or the smell
of soils or ores so that you now you can findout you know which metal is there That means
that there were procedures Uhh of course interms of very Uhh what you call way of color
and smells they could identify where the mineis located and they could Uhh you know bore
those things and find out whether it is viableor not to have digging the mines
And Uhh in this text the description aboutores mines of gold silver copper iron tin
and precious stones are being mentioned andUhh as I told earlier that the ores of iron
can have color of orange faint red or redlike vermilion and this was very predominant
because this is refers to the brown and rediron ore that is Hematite found abundantly
in our country
So let us Uhh look at some of this prehistoricantiquity in Tinnevelly Tamilnadu which I
have shown here the iron swords like theseare the big swords and daggers this is smaller
daggers This evidence one can find Uhh aboutthe Pandiyan dynasty mentioned in Asoka inscription
in around 250 BC And these daggers what peoplefound out from this excavation is that something
eight to twelve inches and sword is aroundtwo to two point five feet Not only the sword
and daggers but also the arrows javelins lancesiron clamps are made of iron were found during
the excavations
And Uhh it is being claimed by various researchersthat these might be the earlier version of
“Wootz” steel Question might be comingto your mind what is Wootz steel We will be
discussing little bit about it A Wootz steelis a very advanced steel as of now and it
is having super plasticity properties andwe will be discussing little bit about it
later on
And iron clamps were found at Bodh Gaya ataround which are dated back to the 300 BCE
and these are the iron clams I have shownhere which they got from during excavation
of foundation of temples at Bodh Gaya andthese clamps are basically made of wrought
iron And we know that Ayurveda was flourishing in our
country and so also the surgery and the surgerybook is Sushruta Samhita
And surgery was conducted in ancient Indiawhich and we had discussed little bit and
hundred twenty five surgical instruments madeof iron were being mentioned in the Sushruta
Samhita Some of the Uhh you know picturesI have shown here are quite complex How they
are making so minute tools which can be usedfor surgery That is the one question really
bothering me and even today Uhh it is difficultto manufacture them So those manufacturing
techniques of course are not available asof now But one need to find it out how they
were doing at that time
And all of us we know about the rust lessiron pillar at Delhi New Delhi and which is
located in the Qutab Minar Uhh of New Delhiand this is the picture what you will get
here and which is located But it was not establishedthere it is basically from other places and
the earlier view of this pillar is shown herewhich is having a gate and now it is not there
This pillar was basically made by ChandraGupta II around 400 to 413 CE in the honor
of Lord Vishnu on the Mount Vishnupada ornowadays it is known as Udayagiri located
near the Sanchi and Vidisha about fifty kilometerfrom Bhopal
And Uhh of course there is a lot of historicalthings there are people who conquered this
is place during what you call medieval timethey would have bought this to iron pillar
to the Qutab Minar and erected it
So Uhh beside this you will find there areseveral other items that I have shown here
and Uhh this is a very interesting one Helmetfrom the Wootz steel I have taken this from
a book known as the Indian iron by BalasubramaniumR and these are the Indian swords which are
very famous now Uhh also because of its Uhhyou know because of its you know ductility
and also with strength well known and it isalso known as the Damasoda sword
This Wootz steel is being used to protectthe body like these are the body protection
gears which were being used earlier days duringthe war by the warriors Nowadays of course
you are we are getting the bullet proof jacketslike if you look at these are the ancient
bullet proof jackets and these are made ofbasically Wootz steel Wootz steel is an ultra-high
carbon steel exhibiting properties such assuper plasticity and high impact strength
and it qualifies as an advanced material evenin modern terminology So for this Wootz steel
you know Uhh if you look at European struggleda lot to find out how the Indians were making
even during British period Uhh but they weresuccessful later on of making this kind of
materials Woodtz steel
And iron beams temples at Konark being usedand not only in Konark but also Puri and Bhubaneshwar
Odhisa around 640 to 1174 CE and this is thetemple of course which is there in this Uhh
door nearby this place this iron beams arebeing used And it has been claimed that in
the entire world the Indians were the firstto use the beam you know for taking the struc
structural load and which was a very uniqueexperiment Uhh and they had done it successfully
because the load due to the stone is veryvery high and that could be taken by this
iron beams It is not only the Konark templethey have used in the garden temple at Puri
number of iron beams at the lintels of doorsis something ninety five people found out
In the same temple the number of iron beamsbelow the pillar plates is around 239 So it
is a large you know number of beams were beingused People were very much found of using
beams at that time it looks to me made ofiron How they were making what will be the
dimension how they will decide it what willbe the cross-section what will be the length
all those questions comes to mind our mindand Uhh but unfortunately not much is Uhh
data is available as of now However one canexplore it to find out what are the methodology
by which they were designing this
And Uhh of course these are the some of theiron beams that I have shown which are being
autographed during something 1912 and whichwere lying you know Uhh and similarly the
beams in Konark irons are being shown hereand iron were being used profusely at the
time for temple construction and other things
Let us look at iron pillar at Dhar which waserected by eleven century former king Bhoja
in Malwa region of western Madhya PradeshAlthough there is a controversy people say
that before that the iron pillar was thereat Dhar but now people are accepting that
this might be the eleventh century And 3 ofits fragments are located near fifteenth century
at Lat Masjid Lat meaning in Hindi basicallypillar mosque right pillar and of course Masjid
is a mosque These are the pillars that arestill laying means before this Masjid being
made Uhh that Uhh you know that place lotof iron pillars might be there
So let us look at another Uhh you know anotheritem of iron pillar on Mount Abu in Rajasthan
which was erected around 1412 AD and its sizeis twelve feet and nine inches Of course whether
it has been made in a single piece and howthey have made this trident all those things
one has to look at from manufacturing pointof view It is a very remarkable thing that
they have made and there may be several othersiron items which were being lost because it
gets corroded right
And Uhh if you look at like this Uhh duringmedieval times lot of guns and cannons were
made out of iron I will just show you someof them Iron gun at Tanjore which is a seventeenth
century forge-welded iron cannon at Tanjavureastern entrance and this is a very heavy
one and diameter you know like quite hugeand so also the length And cannon at Malik-e-Maidan
in Bijapur which is four meter long and onepoint five meter in diameter weighing around
fifty tons and this gun was brought back fromAhmadanagar in the seventeenth century as
a trophy of war because they won the war andtherefore they will take that gun out and
which was drawn by something four hundredoxen and ten elephants and hundreds of men
To transport basically cannon is not thateasy Even during the war time you know people
left their cannon because they cannot reallytransport it it is very heavy So there is
a another gun I am just discussing the LandaKesab gun in Bijapur and Uhh it was basically
quite huge and around twenty one feet seveninches long and diameter at the breech is
around four feet four inch that means diameterof this gun is outer diameter is around that
whereas the caliber that is the what you callinner diameter through which the cannon will
be passing is one feet seven inch And thelength of the bore is eighteen feet seven
inch and estimated weight around forty seventons
So if you look at how they were deciding whatwill be the length what will be the caliber
and what will be the breech and then why theywere giving a lot of thickness and what pressure
will be developed by that motion because offiring See whether they were they might be
doing it by some thumb rule but one has tolook at it Some studies they has to be done
and lot of science can be unraveled by that
There is a iron gun at the Gulbarga and whichis being taken this figure in 1913 and there
is a iron at the Murshidabad There are severalof them in Murshidabad of what you call West
Bengal and this is known as the great irongun at what is called the conqueror of the
world called Jahankos they named it and eachgun was having their own name
And let me talk about the chemical compositionof iron produced by ancient Indian furnaces
like if you look at Delhi iron pillar is aroundpoint two three carbon of course silicon is
very very rare and phosphorus zero point oneeight And Bhubaneswar iron beams are also
in the similar range but little bit in thehigher side point four five carbon and others
are trace materials and there is also Chromiumand Nickel little bit is there in Bhuvneshwar
iron
I think they may not be adding this thingmaybe part of their ore which they could not
have removed it and which may be acting asa better one you know like on the rusting
point of view The Bastar iron axe which issomething zero point two five to zero point
four five carbon Question is how they werecontrolling carbon whether they were controlling
or not all those questions comes into mindbecause the carbon content will be deciding
the strength of the iron
The smelting iron from Jabalpur 0.59 thisis the recent one they have conducted some
experiment using the ancient procedure andsmelted iron which also they have used the
ancient procedure but demonstrated recentlyThe carbon is 0.016 to 0.043 So if you look
at of course lot of research has been doneby you know in recent time looking at ancient
way of Uhh making iron in India So Uhh I willbe just now I will be discussing about Uhh
the classification of iron and its propertiesin ancient India
Uhh The ancient India Uhh the irons are dividedwith basically Kanta iron Triks Tikshna Loha
and Munda Loha and the soft iron which isbasically Kanta iron Loha is can again classified
as Bhramaka means very soft magnetic ironChumbaka mildly magnetic or sticks to iron
pieces and Karsaka it can attract the ironobjects Dravaka very strong magnetic iron
and Romaka which is permanenet magnet developsstrong magnet field around it It may be Ek
Mukha or Sarva Mukha
So that means you know they have classifiedseveral kinds of magnetic irons and you know
which is known as soft iron and Tikshna ironis Khara develops good cutting edge which
breaks on bending and Sara the softer ironand it has the fibrous fracture Hranala the
hard and tough has fibrous fractures Travarattadevelops good cutting edge Vajra which has
been used in mythological several time whichhas good hardening and tempering property
It has bluish color and hard cutting edgeand Kala develops hard cutting edge after
blue tempering
And the Munda Loha which is basically castiron and this is Mrudu soft brittle iron may
be grey cast iron it has low melting pointKunda is molted grey iron Kadara is white
cast iron If you look at the ancient peoplewere having a very sound knowledge about the
types of iron and its properties So thereforeit is very clear that people were having a
good knowledge about iron and iron makinghow to use it and other things With this I
will stop over In the next lecture we willbe discussing about how Uhh iron was being
processed from the iron ores in the ancienttime Thank you very much
