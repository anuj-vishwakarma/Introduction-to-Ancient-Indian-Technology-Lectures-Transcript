Let us start this lecture with a thought processHandloom textile a signature of Indian Civilization
is the bread earner for millions of peoplein India
Today we will be basically discussing aboutthe textile technology particularly related
to handloom in Ancient India And if you lookat in the last lecture we discussed about
the agriculture I mean for a spanning overthe several lectures and the food is one of
the basic need Apart from that the cloth isanother basic need along with the shelter
So today we will be discussing about how tomake cloth and how our ancestors were doing
that
If you look at the our ancestors were familiarwith different types of plant fibres what
generally people call it bast fibre and thisplant fibres are made from the root grasses
and inner bark of the trees And fortunatelyin India we were having 500 indigenous varieties
of cotton but unfortunately at this we aregrowing only 20 varieties and the rest of
the things had gone with the wind And becauseof India is endowed with very good climate
and good soil therefore several bio-diversitieswe are having very several kinds of cottons
So that is why we need to you know look atthe cotton textile kind of things and fabricate
it so that we can
And cotton was the single largest naturalfibre used in clothing Of course nowadays
lot of other things have come in particularlyartificial fibres like a polyesters nylons
and other things even today the India occupythe second position in cotton production in
the world entire world and there are alsousing the long hair of wild animals such as
wild sheep goat and also camels to twist intorope for weaving and nettings And at present
apart from providing one of the basic necessitiesof human life it is the plays an essential
role to the cultivation of industrial outputand also the textile industry generates a
lot of employment and we do earn you knowlot of money from by exporting it
So therefore it is very important to lookat our textile technology in Ancient India
And as I told earlier textile is the largestindustry in the world which uses fibre as
a raw material and particularly in this countryit is the largest provider of employment after
agriculture And agriculture and the cottontextile making and others also silk or jute
or any other fibres like wool woollen stuffare really going well with the agriculture
So that is important
And beside this the Indian textile industryconsumes a large range of fibres and yarn
where of course pre-dominantly cotton basedearlier days as I told earlier but not today
And annual consumption of cotton fibre inIndia is more than 400 lakh bales 1 bale is
around 180 kg in a year according to 2014and 2015 data
And Indian textile industries particularlyin 2014 and 2015 contributes around 14% to
the industrial production and 4% to countriesGross Domestic Product and 13 percent to countries
export earnings so it is a bit amount of revenueswhat you know we get so also garment
Of course with the introduction of moderntechnology the textile production has increased
considerably but the flexibility in designand also the decorative art work you know
is cannot be implemented in this mechanizetextile machines So therefore the creativity
is being lost among the people masses of thepeople Therefore we need to go back to the
handloom textile
The modern textile also using hazardous chemicalslike Benzene aniline dioxin formaldehyde etcetera
to attract the customers by having good coloursand which not only dangers endangers the health
of the people who are wearing but also pollutesatmosphere and water and you know it is really
not good for to continue and I will be discussingabout little bit more of this points because
lot of you people may not be aware and asI was not aware about that And maybe some
of you will be knowing but still for commonpeople may not be knowing
So let us look at certain data on handloomcloth particularly how it could generates
you know employments According to the 3rdhandloom census in 2009 and 2010 which something
around 6 to 7 years old data but still itis interesting The number of handlooms in
our country is 23.77 lakhs out of which majorityof them are in rural areas around 20.66 lakh
looms And of course 3.11 lakh looms in urbanareas with the poor people you know whom get
employment out of it And interestingly numberof handlooms in North-eastern regions like
of the our country around something you know15.5lakhs and those areas you can say hub
of handlooms around 65 percent of total loomshandlooms are in that part And of course if
you look at independence or before independencewe are having several handlooms but those
are being converted into now what you callpower-looms
Interestingly I will tell you I had gone recentlyto see some handloom myself but when I reach
that place that not a single handloom wasthere which was prevailing may be 5 years
back and all are converted into hand powerlooms And number of person engaged in weaving
and allied activities is around 43.31 lakhpeople of course this number are receding
maybe today it will be little lower numberbecause most of them are either switching
their job or most of them are converting intopower-looms
And number of adult weaver and allied workersis something 38.47 lakh and these people they
get a very good or man days rather per yearwhich is 234 days out of 365 days they could
be employed 234 days it is a great numberand they are self-employed they are not depending
on the people for getting salary And theyalso do from their hard the work unlike the
workers and then they get benefit out of itand get a very good life
So now I will also be emphasizing little bitfurther on why to use Ancient Indian textile
technology That is because the ancient textiletechnologies basically were using natural
dyes as compared to the modern days in whichpeople use artificial dyes And artificial
dyes are not good for health and environment
The common chemicals present in the artificialdyes are aniline formaldehyde dioxin etcetera
whatever I had mentioned earlier These chemicalsare not only toxic but explosive and carcinogenic
And it is hazardous for the people who areusing and particularly in our country where
the poor people are involved in that and notmuch education with them and they are prone
to this hazardous things And they may getlot of disease without their knowledge for
earning their bread and butter
Skin absorb a certain amount of chemical directlyfrom the cloths because the surface area is
more so therefore also you know it can absorba chemicals and which are tight of course
this
cloths particularly nowadays youngsters areusing this cloth which are tight or which
are close enough to the skin and that cancause serious health issues In earlier days
we are using loose cloths and nowadays youknow for to have a commensurate to the contour
of their bodies particularly young peoplethey are using So they are subjected to more
you know harms because of this chemical hazardouschemical being used in textiles modern textile
When toxins are absorbed from clothing theyare taken directly to the lymphatic system
and the blood stream it is as good as injectingthe poison into the blood stream And over
the time they end up in suffocating an individualskin and shutting down the toxin release process
entirely And of course some of people cansustain and some of people can get disease
like your skin diseases and other things
And of course formaldehyde causes a lung cancerand skin and lung irritation and contact dermatitis
right And manufactures always claim that anti-clinganti-shrink and waterproof perspiration proof
moth-proof mild dew resistance and chlorineresistance lot of thing they write on that
to lure the people so that they can use andpeople get also (())(12:11) by their advertisement
Although we know that this is the formaldehydecontaminated clothing and equipment which
is dangerous and one should avoid inhalation& skin contact
But this may be somewhere they will be puttingthis kind of sign but however lot of people
may not be knowing that formaldehyde usedin the in the modern cloths can make poison
cloths basically And under high temperaturehumid condition and all of you will be knowing
that our country is in tropical region expectvarying few regions most of are having high
temperature and humid conditions So thereforeit is dangerous to have the you know the modern
cloths using formaldehyde and other chemicals
Although these dyes make cloth looks gorgeousbut they may cause dermatitis eczema and other
skin diseases especially the dark blue andbrown and black synthetic cloth clothings
And the disperse blue one is classified asa human carcinogenic due to high malignant
tumour levels in lab animals people have conductedexperiment in western countries particularly
what I remember that a dog is subjected tothis kind of things and thy found that it
is affecting the dog and dog being mammalso also the human being is being mammal will
be affected If you look at a person here inthis is basically dyeing this one with of
course a mask in the in the nose and mouthand this is a jean which is you know we people
are using or particularly youth like you areusing
And another important things this syntheticundergarments right Which a lot of people
are using at least I remember my son usedto use that for swimming purposes I told why
you are using that synthetic garments Andtraps body heat encourages chemical absorptions
and create electrostatic build-up which allaffect the sperm count leading to the infertility
in men So this is very dangerous one has tolook at it
And let me tell you lot of poor people withoutany knowledge they are using it Maybe it is
cheaper that is why And maybe it is looksto be gorgeous colourful and one has to also
use I remember that my son when he was smallhe used to always go for that kind of things
which is looking jazzy and then colourfuland synthetic things and one has to basically
not use that
So then question arises what is the way outI mean these are the problems created by the
using these cloths manufacture by the companiesand luring the people by through the battened
advertisements and also the masking the informationAnd it is spoiling the health not only human
health but also the air pollution water pollutionand other things so what is the way out

Way out is that we need to look back the ancientIndian textile technology in which natural
organic fibres and dyeing were used And itcan generate enough number of employments
in India because if we are could get intothat handloom mode and that talents the creativity
satisfaction of doing something helping thepeople will remain and mind and body will
be remain working in balance I will talk aboutlittle later on
And as a result that we can utilize the cottonswhat we get varieties of cottons we do get
We should not get suede by these Bt cottonwhich is a genetically modified cotton nowadays
coming up And we will have to use indigenouscottons and then it will be helpful for us
indigenous right
And let us now look at the textile technologiesin Ancient India pertaining to the literally
evidences So if you go back to the Ramayanyou can find the nettle cloth has been mentioned
in Ramayan at times and the references tolinen a one kind of fibre and one can make
a cloth occur in Maitraayansanhitaa and 4000BC And in Taittiriyasanhita in 1600 BC kind
of things So that means our ancestors wereaware about how to use this fibre for cloth
and Hemp is one kind of again fibre Is botanicalname is Cannabis sativa one of the strongest
and most durable all natural textiles hasbeen mentioned in Satapatha Barahman in Veda
around people claim to be something 4000 to1000BC as sana It is known as sana
So Arthasastra handbook of administrationas tentatively dating to the 3rd century BC
dealt with methods of distributing materialfor to the spinners and weavers that means
this cotton jute linen and other things hasto be distributed through the government machinery
at that time and as being done today So ifyou look at that system was there earlier
days to cloth Arthasastra also mention abouttextile such as white bark cloth from Orissa
linen from Banaras cotton from South Indiaand several kinds of blankets
You might be knowing a story about blanketswhich was around the Chankaya right I will
not get into that because of paucity of timeand if you look at this is the thing I want
to show you that this is the nettle ant whichis very fine And this is the linen cloth which
is having a very good you know strength andthen it is being used nowadays nowadays people
are very much you know gaga about this clothis coming up again So also the nettle nettle
yarn And this is about the hemp fibre bagswhich is lot of eco-friendly people are promoting
nowadays not only in this country other countriesalso
And I will tell you that lot of concern amongthe people at this moment for the using unnatural
fibres and also the textiles and mix textileis also is bad because you cannot really recycle
it And you cannot destroy it also becauseif you put that to destroy on the maybe soil
or something that again it will affect thesoil Whereas the cotton if it is made out
of natural way or handloom it can you knowbe it can be destroyed very easily
So that is the problem what we need to lookat that is why we need to go back to the ancient
way of using it particular textile technologyand learn something from that and carry forward
So the record of Ancient and Medieval Indiatextile exist mostly literature and sculptures
right If you look at there is a archaeologicalevidence of a cotton textile industry at Mohenjo-Daro
in the Indus Valley civilization around 3500BC Of course few fragments survive from much
later periods but you know to get evidenceabout the textile is very difficult this thing
but however people are trying to look at thisimage what they got And this portion if you
look at this portion is basically of madeof textile kind of thing So therefore they
are thinking that you know this Mohenjo-Daropeople were having knowledge of textiles
And when alexander invaded this country andhe saw and wrote about the fine flower muslins
you know one kind of very fine cloths rightAnd ropes embroidered in gold in India you
know if you look at today also people arehaving very fine gold being embroidered in
the cloth particular in Banaras regions andwhich are those cloths are you know the sarees
and the other things are quite costly butstill that work is going on at this moment
but maybe it may not really sustain further
And few good commentaries also observe fromearly medieval periods 900-1200 AD And the
fabric name names apparently represent theplaces they belong because India was a country
as I told it is not a country it is a basicallysub-continent The several various cultures
each people having their own way of nettingthat is the beauty of the what India was having
Not like the mill cloth where all the designwill be similar or people are having their
own speciality and they that is why in variousregions this cloth was woven and details about
weaving techniques were scanty kind of thingsbecause unfortunately those things are not
recorded because the methodologies are notrecorded properly The it the knowledge of
the making these fabrics and then designsmotifs in that cloth are basically transfer
from one generation to another Due to suddenintroduction of this textiles mill textile
of course it started with the Britishers andnowadays it is being very blatantly used and
those things are not recorded properly
And if you look at another traveller likeMarco Polo who came around 1294 AD and mentioned
about the production of buckrams the finestand most beautiful cloth in the world like
the tissues of the spider webs in CoromandelCoast that is in Deccan areas of the Tamil
Nadu Dyeing with indigo in the great textilecentre of Cambay and spinning of cotton in
Gujarat of course I will tell you I am notgoing to talk about the history I have taken
few of the points because the history is quiteexhaustive in nature and I will not get into
that
But I will just want to impress on you peoplethat we are having evidence that ours were
the very good in textile technology DuringMuslim period in India 1200 to 1760 kind of
thing textile arts flourished until late 17thcentury but unfortunately what happened like
in the Britishers came and then they basicallyintroduced the mill textile technologies into
this
country and then they did not allow the weaversto you know make the textiles and there was
a lot of rift among the local people and thethe British government at that time who was
ruling in this country forcefully
And that is why lot of things you know peoplegot dissuaded not to have textile If you look
at like this I have shown you just to a variouskinds of textiles what I was mentioning to
you just look at each region let us say Kashmirthis is the Jammu Kashmir region is having
a different kind of fabric Whereas the Punjabwill be having each state is having their
own varieties specialities and let me justtell you that this look very beautiful And
if you go to each state each zila or the districtwill be having their own speciality of the
design and also the fabrics
So if you look at count all those things itwill be enormous So that kind of display or
the manifestation of creativity among thepeople And if we will go for the the handloom
and we can retain the creativity of the peoplewhich is the natural nature of human being
And flourish it further and they can leada very peaceful life So therefore it is important
to look at this thing and I will stop overhere that what is the beauty and then aesthetic
sense of our people were having earlier daysthat can be reflected in the textile textures
made by our weavers even today and unfortunatelythis is at stake and in a very bad shape at
this moment due to the various reasons whichI am not going to discuss but I will urge
all of you to take necessary steps as an individualas a group to keep our you know technology
intact and also record it how it is beingdone that is important Thank you very much
