Let us start this lecture with a thought processTough time does not last forever; but it makes
you tougher forever So don’t get shy awayfrom tough time Fight with yourself so that
you will be tougher So uhh before startinglet us recapitulate what we learnt in the
last lecture We basically looked at variousaspect of the Physics like your optics and
other things And the later on I moved to thechemistry part how it was And then we looked
at also little bit about uhh what you calllike games like ludo and then what we call
Pachisi and then uhh your uhh snakes and laddersand other things and then we also discuss
about uhh what you call uhh other aspectsof the uhh I mean other arts form various
things and then we moved into also the howwe can utilize the NCN technology of making
roof in place of concrete or the RCC- Reinforceconcrete roof kind of things
Let us now discuss about what you call problemswith the modern agricultural farming because
we will be discussing it with agricultureAgriculture is very important for the food
As our ancestors says Anna Prathistha DevThat means we need to have a food even for
the God you know to exist So therefore itis important
And artificial fertilizers we are using andso are the herbicide which is spoiling the
soil and polluting the rivers lakes and waterresources In the name of growing more we are
doing that And we are you know uhh as a resultthe soils with the low organic matter content
we are having and it became infertile andour body is getting diseases And we are depending
too much on the fertilizers As a result ifyou look at our farmers are committing suicide
because they are in death trap
Of course we are trying to propagate a zerobudget you know farming And which was there
earlier in our country Ok We should do thatAnd it is integrated with that Our ancestors
were very aware how to do farming but we donow know because of utilization of modern
science and technology driven by the marketprocesses And greater amount of fertilizers
needed year after year to produce same yieldof crop for example let’s say 10 years back
for acre they are putting let’s say 10 kgof urea
But today you will have to produce at leastgive something uhh may be uhh 30kg Then you
know cost is increasing And the soil is gettingspoiled So as we are using also pesticides
because the eco system is being spoiled becauseof that and there is a imbalance because there
is a pest and pray kind of things which willbe balancing each other So artificial pesticide
what we are using We will stay on the soilfor longer time enter into our food chain
and then we get diseases Artificial chemicaldestroy the soil micro organism This modern
people have not understood there is a lotof micro organism which are working For that
we you know nature works on that
Even in our body it is there Even on the surfaceof your skin it is there So we should not
destroy They are the part of the nature Theyare doing lot of work which we do not know
understand No of course the modern sciencehas started realizing this But our ancestors
were might be aware They were in the balanceThat is the thing key what they have talked
about it As a result this destruction of thesoil micro organism the poor soil structures
and aeration problem there is a decreasingof nutrient availabilities As I was telling
pest and diseases become more difficult tocontrol as they becoming resistant to the
artificial pesticide
Because you pesticide put and they will getresist you know resistance So that you go
for a higher level of chemicals to have thateffect Then you know you are spoiling the
whole soil water air and your body and thenso as a result the habitat loss also is going
on So which is very important therefore wholesystem we are in deep trouble in the name
of what development Right And people are makingmoney and we are in trouble So this is not
the way we should do Then what is the solutionSolution is basically go back to the farming
the our ancestors doing but you need to doresearch in such a way that you will have
to handle the present situation because youhave spoiled now
Now you will have to get back to the earlierthing is not that easy Right Is it like that
you have already put a arrow and then youwill have to take it back It will go and hit
So it is a difficult dicey situation one hasto handle Therefore you need to
Of course this farming has now come up fromthe western name It is organic farming In
India we call it as a Prakritik Krishi orthe natural farming which was very much there
And this is organic farming is as old as Indiancivilization because ours is a agriculture
country Even today 75% populations are relyon the agriculture as a you know enterprise
So it is the process of farming developedand professed by your ancestors But we lost
it And then you know we are now using theirtechnology
They is being modified is coming now the organicfood food whatever available in mass and is
much costlier than the when you are usingthe what you call uhh artificial fertilizers
and pesticide and herbicides So what is thisThis is nothing but a mere business You know
we are spoiled So therefore we are workingon that uhh zero budgets Lot of people are
working I think some of you should look atand some IITians after leaving the jobs they
are doing that now in some pockets of Indiain the interiors I am having some you know
contact with them They have left the job Theyare doing because they find this is more you
know interesting and then uhh what you callsatisfying
The British survey of 2000 village of Chengalpattuin Tamil Nadu in 1762-1766 You know data says
that yielding was around 12 tonnes of paddya hector which is much higher than whatever
the urea whatever the artificial fertilizerused It is the process of cultivation that
organic farming or the natural farming whatwe call is basically work in harmony with
the nature unlike modern farming that wasagainst the Mother Nature So that is the important
aspect which I am harping on this course Thatscience and technology should be aligned with
the plans and the programs of the Mother Naturethan that of going against it That is the
basic philosophy one has to put it which ismodern science and technology is unable to
understand And that is why all problems arecoming
Modern science is trying to solve one problembut creating another 100 problems which cannot
be solved Right So that is not the way Wayis that you understand plan and programs and
other things align with that so that thingswill be very natural So this process helps
to achieve good crop yield without harmingthe natural environment habitats When you
talk about it is men animals insects microorganism plants air water altogether It is
not that you will you know look at in a itis a holistic approach the whole approach
it is not the part
It is not that you know like what you callit would not be the what you call BBC the
whole reductionist it is not that we reducethe thing and then we look at in a whole That
is a main problem thing So you can look atthis data what I gave you Particularly this
12 ton in 2000 You can look at Anna Bahu Kurvitaby JK Baja and MD Srinivas They are having
Centres for Policy Studies I have taken fromthis you know website this data They have
done some research there for the indigenousknowledge system
So I will just give you some data about thequality of the food because quality of food
is important for the health And if you lookat these are basically vegetables like you
know Snap Beans Cabbage Letus Tomatoes andspinach And this is minerals what it will
be containing Calcium magnesium potassiumsodium manganese iron and copper This data
I have taken from the uhh research conductedby Firman E Bears & Rutgers University in
the Natural Gardner Catalogue
If you look at this is there is a term ifyou look at one is organic right And other
is conventional Ok Conventional means thewith urea with your pottas or any other chemicals
you are using That is the traditional Ok ConventionalOrganic means where you would not be using
using natural things Ok Are you getting mypoint So now if you look at let us say iron
in the tomatoes If we use organic which isnatural farming what our ancestors were doing
you will get 1938 milliequivalent You knowwhat is a milliequivalent A 1000’s of a
gram in a some kind of things you know likevery small quantities A one litre or some
kind of units for the saying that (())(10:26)And this is one
So you know that iron is very essential forthe what For our body All minerals are you
know somewhere it is required So similarlyif you look at spinach or any other things
it is like that If you look at sodium letus say this is 650 and it is zero and this
spinach 695 and this What I am trying to saywith this data that look if you do that it
is having higher level of the minerals whichare required for the for our body We need
not to take some vitamin tablets You knowlike for as a supplement So it is important
And why it is so I could have shown you maybe in agriculture when I talk about it I now
remember I will show you What will be theroot size when you do naturally and what will
be the root size when you do with with theartificial uhh fertilizers
So that question we will answer Let us nowlook at irrigation systems If you look at
irrigation you might be aware The introductionyou know the Grand anicut which is in Cauvery
river which is quite old you know like something2000 year old and all There is a river River
Kollidam and river Cauvery They mix togetherhere and there is a you know the confluence
the downstream confluence there is a anicutwhich was being made in the Chola kingdom
which is very old And this area irrigatedby ancient irrigation network you know is
about something 69000 acres of land at thattime But after that there is a modification
I don’t know this is now around 1 millionacres is increased Ok
And this is a very old dam And most of thatdam if you look at having problems You know
what are the problems in the modern dams whatbeing made by our modern engineers Any idea
Silting Silting is the big problem Ok Andthat is hardly may be 70 years 80 years These
are 2000 years
Student: Sir can you please mention the dateof this Grand anicut
Professor: It is something around 2000 yearsback We will be discussing about this when
I will be talking irrigation system
Ok So this Anicut was in you know need tobe maintained and there is a renovation work
done by the British engineers in 1838 andthey were finding lot of problems with that
They couldn’t manage well And then whatthey did they uhh had a dialogue with the
local people which at the time you know andthere they could get the solution They were
very unsuccessful in the beginning to handlethis one They were thinking they can do because
they were great engineers Ok and then theylearnt from the local people that is something
1874 Later Cotton who paid tribute to thesepeople native Indians who had instrumental
in imparting the knowledge for making thisuhh success successful renovation of this
Grand anicut
What he says He says that it was from themthe native Indians; we learn how to secure
a foundation in loose sand of unmeasured depthAre you ready to learn from them now No na
They had learnt He is saying 1874 when weare under them And in fact what we learnt
from them made the difference between financialsuccess and value They were you know always
saying that we are putting money we are notgetting back But this local native people
taught them how to do that For the Madrasriver irrigation executed by our engineers
have been from the first greatest financialsuccess of any engineer works in the world
But we are not taking care of local knowledgeor the indigenous knowledge They had taken
care Solely because we learnt from them withthis lesson about foundation we built bridges
after learning that from the native peopleThey learnt how to build bridges weirs aqueducts
and every kind of hydraulic work and it goeson We are this deeply debted to the native
engineers Where are these native engineersLet me tell you it is also some of them are
coming up Some of the people are working Weare not working They have revived the river
the village people which was dead
I will be talking about that when I will goto irrigation system It is not don’t think
that you people know the engineering Ok Thepeople who are uhh in the villager uneducated
they do not know They know because I toldyou science is nothing but a common sense
at the best They are having better commonsense than all of us So therefore we should
not looked down upon them rather work withthem and learn from them what we need
So this is about a Natraj Temple Can you seethat It is very intricate How we can make
it What are what are the method you need todo All of you are engineers Tell me Casting
What kind of casting How many castings youare aware What kind of casting it will be
And they had done long time back Ok It goesback to the uhh what you call uhh even Harappan
no no I think later on Ok This is known aslost wax casting And this casting was being
used right for making these intricate safeRight And this is made of 5 metal which is
known as Panchdhatu
It is nothing but alloy People were knowingthe alloys And the metal uhh crafting has
started in South India during 6 and 9 centuryWhat you call C that is common era But before
that it was there also And they are mastersby the Pallava dynasty And this method is
basically known as the investment or the lostwax casting method and which is being used
today for casting of turbine blades Ok Andour ancestors didn’t do that for turbine
blade They were doing for idols for otherthings
So and if you look at this is the iron pillarYou might be knowing rustless Western people
spend lot of money and time to understandwhat it is Why is it so They worked hard they
couldn’t Right And this was being made byif you look at it is a view of Ashokan Pillar
now it is in Qutub Minar And a pillar at VaishaliOne of the edicts of Asoka which is 272- 231
reads: “Everywhere King Piyadasi” KingPiyadasi means basically Asoka erected two
kinds of hospital hospital for people hospitalfor animals as I told
We are not only for the hospitals for thepeople but also animals Today we don’t have
hospital you know enough hospital to accommodateour people That is the situation They were
having for animals Forget about animals Sowhere there were no healing where there were
no healing herbs for the people animals Heordered that they be bought and planted Ok
That was intricate things So if you look atthis as the portion I have taken This portion
I have taken from region and magnified hereRight What you see This portion what you see
What is the shape of this It is a if you lookat a Kalash kind of thing Ok How they are
making these thing How I will fabricate thisThese are the questions we will answer whenever
we will be going to talk about iron makingand black smith metal working But you just
talk about think I am saying inverted KalashRight Why is it there Because that is the
signature of our civilization In your houseany auspicious occasion you will have Kalash
And it will be filled fully with water Whyit is so Please ask this question And this
is also reflected here so I will answer someother time But you think about
And this is about Sun Temple in Konark inOrissa built by Ganga dynasty around 1250
CE and if you look at it is one of the wondersin the world That is known as Black Pagoda
And how was it built Was it but without anyengineering Because they were not Right but
where those engineers have gone Do we recognizethem Do we teach these things how to do Do
we how to maintain our temple Do you knowhow to repair and you know maintain an existing
temple No na So we need to do that becausethe number of temples in India is so large
it is impossible to believe that they werecreated without any sound technologies Because
the King Choda Ganga Dev he spent 12 yearsof his savings of the whole kingdom for making
a temple like this
Do you think that you will give money unlesshe was having faith in the technology If I
want to give 500 rupees to anybody I willthink several times whether he can deliver
me or not Right and he was a king So thereforeit was there And what technology did ancient
people in India possess that made so manyof structures possible we lost it But we can
revive it We can study it There might be somescriptures somewhere So it is important because
these temples are living till date existingand we are using it We should learn it And
how to maintain it
So if you look at the Kedarnath temple andit is a temple of something 2000 years people
claims and before flash flood this templewas like that You know all are the new structures
Agreed After the flash flood what is thereThis temple is where are the new structures
Gone with the flash flood Why People say itis a miracle I told no it is the technology
what our ancestors have built Right So I meanpeople were having that and then we need to
look at it
Similarly if you look at Pashupatinath Templeand which was a you know built around 11th
Century C and renovated in 17th Century Andthis was the temple which is a lot of in a
Pagoda base And we know that uhh this is aheight of 23 meters and 7 cms from the base
of the Pinnacle It is a very you know longtemple
And so if you look at this is temple lot ofstructures were there And the earth quake
you know it is a Richter scale of somethingaround 78 or something I am not remembering
exactly It is a very high But what happenedThe temple is remaining Rest of the things
have gone That means it is the technologythat is it what So therefore we need to study
that and the technologies
And therefore let me tell you that what GeorgeBernard Shaw has told He says that Indian
way of life provides the vision of naturalreal way of life But today we don’t have
that life We veil ourselves with unnaturalmask today You know he is saying that they
are veiling their unnatural you know theyare cover their you know the mind and the
body you know like consistness with unnaturalmass We are also doing And on the face of
the India a tender expression which can carrythe mark of the Creator’s hand
If you lead a natural balanced life integratedwith the mother nature you can know a lot
of what you call intuitive knowledge fromthe mother nature and you can do better science
and engineering That is the I can interpretin that Am I right My interpretation So let
me moral of the story I would like to saythat we need to relook revive rejuvenate for
the renaissance of our scientific cultureand heritage of glorious mother land that
is Bharat what we call in modern time India
So with this we will stop over here and weare having a very journey of I was trying
to tell you that what is the gamut of theancient Indian science and technology we are
having And we have learnt that we are havinga lot of stuffs and lot of uhh you know technologies
still existing in some pockets And those thinghas to be also renovated has to be maintained
properly For that we need to learn and alsowe need to look at the philosophy of the Indian
science and technology which was unique becauseit was integrated with the mother nature and
not mechanised that way that it will spoilthe mind of a person
Today you people are using all electronicgadgets and then what you call your all those
things getting engaged and you are spoilingyour mind Your intellectuality would not be
blossomed unless you have a peace of mindand a very tranquillity in that So we need
to have a technology And I must tell you thatwe need to go back to a technology which is
need not to be automated unless otherwiserequired
Like for your blast furnace and some otherplaces where man cannot go you can robots
and do that rest of the things we need tohave technology which will generate more jobs
more mechanical and so that mind and bodyand the spirit will be in balance So that
is the basic philosophy of ancient technologyand it should be integrated with the modern
mother nature So that we live a very fruitfuland productive and enjoyable life on this
earth and make this earth a beautiful placeThank you very much for listening to me And
that is the essence of the philosophy of ancienttechnology what I am trying to propagate
Thank you very much
