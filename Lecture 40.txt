Let us start this lecture with a thought processhuman life is as elegant and fragile as a
glass jar And today we will be discussingabout glass technology in ancient India A
question might be coming to your mind whatis glass A glass is basically a non-crystalline
amorphous solid with wide usage And chemicalcomposition of glass varies you know from
place to place and also Uhh it depends onapplications
The main constituent of glass is basicallysilica and of course it is having various
forms The glass generally contains around75 percent silica and then rest of the additives
like sodium oxide sodium carbonate lime andvarious other colouring you know additives
are being used for making glass And theseI have shown some of the ancient glass beads
from Kochi in Kerala and we will be talkingabout little bit historical aspects later
on
Let us see that how this glass was evolvedthe vitreous paste the frit faience glazed
pottery were known as the cousin of glassand its evolutionary stages And of course
it was being you know evolved due to the continuousdevelopment in pyro technology which form
the basis for the manufacturing of glass Andlater on of course composite pyro technology
was used
This pyro technology can handle the low meltingpoint in pure glass U As a result the workability
Uhh of the glass can be improved Let us lookat how and when glass was originated in India
Uhh in Harappan side you will not real findany glass objects as being claimed by researchers
However later on around 300 BC in some archaeologicalsites people have found bangles beads and
other faience items From this evidence onecan conclude that the science of coloured
glass using cupric and cuprous oxide wereknown to Indians at least around 300 BC
And most discovered glasses were of blue andred colour which might be due to abundant
availability of copper in this region In Haryanaaround 200 BC Uhh some of the glasses made
of black and sky blue colour were being obtainedin the excavation sites which may be due to
the presence of cupric copper and nature ofglass at various sites When you look at most
of the archaeological sites have discoveredbeads bangles seals and ornamental pieces
Of course nowadays the glass is very cheapand we use for various other applications
optics you know like your laser glass andthen several places But at that time it was
considered to be very previous and they wereused as ornaments and glass flourished during
the Mauryan period because the people havefound out several seals from Kumrahar and
Bulandibagh areas
And these are the seals which were obtainedyou know from these two sites and these are
all Bhrami ‘lipis’ are being mentionedthey were using it as a seal And most chemical
analysis show that they are low in silicaand has soda and potash maybe for lowering
the melting point of the glass And iron wasbeing used for as a colouring agent because
iron was there eastern part of the countryand even other parts of the country also and
chromium was used for colouring but it wasconfined to certain regions If you look at
here I am showing you a glass seal of 24 cmsquare and 10 mm thick which was obtained
in Maheswar MP and other seals in MP thisone and which is having a colour of amber
And there is several seals were obtained inTaxila Uhh during excavation there are several
seals of different you know motifs are thereand from this one can conclude that the science
of annealing was known to the ancient glassmaking people because the strength of this
glass was quite good which cannot be possiblewithout annealing it
That is a seal glass seal which was obtainedin Maheswar in 300 BC The glass disks and
ear reel with different colour were foundduring the excavation and black glass disk
with legend Bhrami script in red glass werehoused in the museums of Patna Banaras and
Allahabad region One can get it I must tellyou that lot of this excavated items are being
preserved in various museums across the countryone can visits and find it out and also do
research on that And this disk might be fabricatedby pulling large size glass scales what people
have anticipated
Uhh The ear reels in good numbers are beingreported from Ujjain Maheswar in MP Nasik
Kaundinyapur in Vidarbha region which arecoloured with white Vermilion opaque and blue
and green colour That means they were usinga lot of colouring agent for that or maybe
some impurities are there And of course thisis still the Common Era what was earlier known
Christian era
And people are claiming that western particularlywestern people particularly from Rome they
influenced the glass technology in India becauseof there was a trade between the Rome and
India at that time And Uhh the local industrymight have acquired some new technology of
glass making from the west particularly theglass bowls and mosaic tablets were imported
as claimed by some of the researchers Butmore research has to be done to you know prove
it because reason given by the researchersis not that sound And presence of glass tiles
was evident that local industry was flourishat that time
And particularly let me just show you theglass bowl in Taxila which has been shown
here and these were made in Taxila by theforeign technology as claimed by some researchers
but I feel that more research should be doneto prove that And Nevasa in Maharashtra yielded
12 rim glass contained in emerald green andblue and yellow colours and Uhh the glass
tiles of square you know 10.25 inch and 0.2thickness was obtained in Maharastrian excavation
And glass was also flourished in Satvahanaperiod around something 50 BC to 250 C in
Deccan region It is not that only the Taxilaand other Indus valley area civilisation area
Harappan site but also the other parts likesouthern part also having evidence of glass
items So this glass flask was obtained fromTaxila which dates back to around 100 C
So there are several Uhh as you call glassobjects were obtained from the Satvahana sites
These are the objects basically top view isshown here and here these are the utensils
and these are various items which are shownstarting from the bead to the various intricate
complicated shapes you know sizes being obtained
So let us look at how glass was manufacturedof course the ingredients were generally used
the river sands or crude Natrons and colouringagents These are the three ingredients which
are important Though the calcium carbonatewas added but sand containing lime was directly
used due to their abundant availability Letus look at the two stage process which is
being talked about First of course is thesand and natron were being heated to the temperature
of 750 degree Celsius which you called thefrit
Frit is partly fused glass and then subsequentlyit is heated in a crucible around 1100 degree
Celsius so that you know it will be homogenousand become clear Finally poured into a mould
to the cast seals or slabs or any other thingswhat you can think of or it can be rolled
into rods to make them canes or sticks Andif you look at the same casting process is
being used what you know we have discussedduring the metal casting process The features
of Indian glass if you look at the annealingof the glass objects were carried out to improve
the quality and most of the objects were translucentnot transparent
Of course later on the transparent glass wasmade in country But in earlier days it was
not and chemical analysis reveal that it wasthey have high aluminium content but low lime
content and low magnesium And most ancientglasses are soda lime silica glasses as I
told that melting point will be very low andeven today also people are using these glass
for making beads and other things in the UPand some other places also And most glasses
contain iron oxide because it was profuselybeing across the country and it is as a part
of impurity people might be adding to colourthe glass There are no traces of lead antimony
tin and prosperous due to the source of rawmaterial being you know
Let us look at some of the colouring agentslike cupreous oxide is used for the red and
liver red and ferric oxide is brown and ferrousoxide being from black and tin oxide for white
colour and of course for green mixture ofcupreous Ferrous and ferric oxide being used
and for turquoise blue is cupric oxide beingused and cobalt oxide is used for deep blue
and ferric oxide for yellow magnesium oxidefor violet So these are the colouring agents
what you know ancient what were being usedin ancient time for making glass
Actually the foreign technology has come someof the people are talking about it but mostly
the industry as indigenous limited to beadsand bangles That is indigenous technology
of glass making was limited to the beads andbangles as claimed by some researchers and
if they find that lead antimony and tin insome of the glasses they always say that this
is of foreign origin
But I do not I really could not say why becauselead was here in this country tin was also
there so why they will say that it is of foreignorigin is a questionable thing And potash
glasses having high silica content also givean indication of Roman glass and potash is
being used in our iron the rustless iron pillarI had discussed So why these people are saying
that one has to also do research and findout Because of these two reasons they are
saying these glasses are from the westerncountries
And of course you can find presence of bariumand lead in some glasses prove that Chinese
Indian traded as old as 200 BC Again if youlook at that way I do not know what they are
interpreting This is the logic which is givenby researcher which I do not think is right
maybe right I do not know but more researchis required to you know remove these doubts
from the minds of the people
So variety of glass objects were made in ancienttimes and some of these objects are you know
being mentioned here like bead making andeven till we are making the bead be not only
the beads but bangles and hollow wares andmoulding glass objects and glass blowing process
So some of the things medieval indian glassesshown here it is of various very colourful
and lot of items you know how they are makingthis art it is basically an art It is very
looking you know very complicated and alsogorgeous and colourful
So various tools were being used for makingglass wares in ancient India some of them
I am just you know discussing here One isSihka sikha is basically long rod meant for
stirring the molten glass and semi moltenglass And tokkla tokkla is iron rod with a
thick butt and tapered point and if you lookat the Sarrendi a straight iron rode used
for manipulating blown bubbles of glass AndCitarna an iron rod used for providing zig
zag shape to the bangles because for makingbangles you have to give that shape
And Sarangajana which have shown a figurehere a long tapering rod of iron fitted with
wooden handle this is your wooden handle whichis used to separate bangles in semi molten
state and of course the smaller one is knownas bandhana The Kalcul it is an iron ladle
used for dishing out molten glass This isthe Kalcul Ankari is a long iron rod hooked
at one end used for stirring the molten glassAnd let us look at the patha it is a dagger
shaped used for pressing and moulding glassin the molten state and this similar thing
is also being used for concrete work
And the Kalbut or Thapi is a clay cone usedfor enlarging the glass bangles to require
size it will be rotated I will be showingsome of these things to you in a video Nal
of course what we call Phunkuni is basicallya pipe through which you will be blowing the
glass and Massa iron seer used to shape theobjects and separating from the blow like
this is a Massa it is basically a tong inEnglish you can call And Cimta some people
call it Simta it is an iron tong to handlebroken chips of glass and Sil the slab stone
used for marvering it
So let us look at bead making Uhh what isbeing done during the bead making is that
first the molten glass will have to be stirredwith an iron bar as I told Lump of this glass
gathers at one end and once is done then fixanother iron bar on the lump and maybe another
craftsman will be pulling this quickly andrunning with a pace That means he will be
travelling towards that with pace to froma long rod see rod is being made like that
right Suppose if you are having some glassand then you move it right and at a little
speed so that glass can be made and usinga small twig glass tubes are formed and air
cavity was created before pulling the lumpusing a blown iron that means you can make
a tube
Of course this is for making a what you callhollow type the glass tube we want to make
by this This may be used for bead making ormay not be But one can make by blowing the
air through that And tubes were specific diameterdrawn out and cut and rods and threads were
wound around an iron rod and cut These arethe process what is being done like basically
to make this beads and then
I will be showing you a video that how thisbead can be made and it is again it has to
be rotated If you take this thing and youwill make it rotate with an iron rod sticking
to this glass right and one can rotate thatthing so that it will be moving through and
then one bead can be made
So let us see that how the glass bead is beingmade So here it is what you call flame which
is coming out of burning of liquid fuel nowadayspeople are using kerosene but earlier days
people were using the bio oil or vegetableoil and of course there is a way of blowing
the air that you can get a blue flame Andblue flame is essential for making Uhh good
uncontaminated bead So if you look at whatis this artist is doing he is rotating the
glass which is on the Uhh what you call inthe iron rod
This is your iron rod and as it is rotatingits taking a bead shape and you can say it
is basically something centrifuging effectwill be there here and after that he will
be suing this thing for a die to get someproper shape and size kind of things so this
is the way how the glass bead is being made
Due to larger contraction in the wire thanin the glass it was easy to remove from the
wire and uniform finishing can be obtainedto due to heat treatment because some annealing
can be done about that Let us now look atbangle making what is being done here one
has to you know take out small about of moltenglass using an Ankuri or a hook to wound around
a spit to give it a ring shape
Then this ring shape is allowed to cool usinga dagger and transferred to a cone and the
cone will be rotating I will be showing avideo to show that As a result the centrifugal
force will acting and then you know it willbe enlarged and it will take a proper circular
shape The cone is spun rapidly and the ringis pushed to the desired shape finally it
is slipped off and cooled so this is a verysimple technique even people are using today
And Uhh this you can call it as a centrifugalcasting or a semi centrifugal casting because
RPM is not that much here.
So let us look at what is being done hereThis is use kind of a molten glass is being
taken and then it will put into round shapeand it is putting into this rotating cone
and then which is enlarging again it is beingtaken and then to that So this is the process
by which what you call the bangle is beingmade So look at this is the cone which is
rotating at a certain RPM and depending uponRPM it will get into and it will end here
There is a stopper so that you know size canbe managed with this stopper on this bangle
which is rotating.
Let us see now that hallow glass wares beingmade by the core technique And these are some
of the glassware from Gujarat I have shownwhich is hallow and this is a glass which
we use to used earlier days nowadays we areusing plastic tumbler And hallow glasswares
found in Devenimori in Gujarat Amerli in Sauratsraregion of Gujarat Ter in Maharashtra and other
places Uhh which were considered to be youknow manufactured by the core technique What
is being done here a stick or a rod housinga conical end is coated with a ball of sand
held together by a cloth That means basicallya cone was there and then what is being done
that some sand being placed with the helpof a cloth and then and this is your mould
you can say one kind of mould
The stick is dipped into a molten glass andtaken out immediately and then alternately
thin rods in the soft forms were wound aroundthis code and fire polished to give a finish
That means basically you will have to go toyou know then go on trying to melt the rest
of the material out of the outer side andyou will get a hollow glassware Finally the
core with the sand is removed on the coolingor giving to a hollow core because the sand
is there then you can remove the sand portionBasically sand is used as in insulating material
also for that you can have a mould and dothat
So this is a simple technique what was beingdevised earlier is being used and let us look
at the Moulding of glass objects This methodis one of the simplest and used to prepare
glass tiles and seals And it follows the samemetal casting procedure what we have discussed
earlier First of all the glass is to be meltedand then it has to be poured into a clay sandstone
or a siliceous moulds and then of course thisI have shown here which is not of ancient
origin but the present one which is thereThe mould is here already and you will melt
the glass and then pour it and it will slowlyenter into this mould and take a shape
And you allow it to cool so that you willget a glass object out of this There is another
technique that is glass blowing process Andin this process is considered to be imported
from western country like particularly Romeand blowing was done either way either in
a mould or in a free manner You can see evenglass blowing section people do use like a
glass by the free manner and that is an artor you can use a pipe to blow that air in
proper manner In the mould a small lump wastaken and blown introduced in a bi valve mould
that in the two side right we can separateit blown to fill it up Whereas in free blowing
lump is blown and the shape using a polishedsteel or brass board so that you will get
a proper shape kind of thing
So let me show you that a bowl of glass fromBhramanabad which is something around 40 AD
was obtained in the Sindh site and is nowpreserved in the Prince of Wales museum because
this was obtained in 1909 before independenceSo and this glass iridescent glass dates back
to the 400 CE and it has been anticipatedthat it might be made by the blowing melted
method or the blowing process you know inan open mould better But how it was made it
was really not been talked about it and thenone has to find out
And this is a pitcher which I guess it canbe done maybe by what you call rotating the
things so that you will get a good shape Somore research you need to be you know carried
out to find out how it was made in earliertimes Let me tell you what I have done in
this I have tried to take the ancient technologieswhich are related to the life for example
agriculture then water Uhh and also the clothingslike textiles we have discussed and we have
also discussed about the housings and besidesthese metallurgical things
And if you have looked it that kind of technologywhich were discussed in this lecture you can
conclude and I have a feel that these technologiesare quite simple and quite elegant in nature
And these technologies can be improved onand also can be used today without spoiling
the Mother Nature most of them are organicin nature And they find they were using the
local materials and also indigenously developingthis technologies And these a lot of scope
were there for more innovation and as I toldman is a creative and curious creature by
nature
So therefore it is essential for a personto be creative and then we can indulge in
these kind of arts or the cottage industriessuch that we will feel satisfied and happy
about it And also we can earn some money inthe process and keep the tradition So therefore
my suggestion to all of you who are takingthis course is that this is a very important
thing and we need to keep these indigenoustechnology alive and also the as a part of
our heritage we will we will take responsibilityfor its propagation and do that
Because we are facing the problem of culturalinvasion what these Britishers and then Muslim
rules of the other things for years togetherthey could not really you know spoil our culture
the way this globalisation and then othermodern times Uhh spoiling or taking away our
culture and heritage So therefore I wouldlike to ask upon all of you that whatever
I have shown you it is a very very you knowtip of the iceberg is a very small portion
There is lot of things are there what we cando one way is that we attend we know this
thing but very important thing we need tospend you know some of our valuable time whatever
we got in this life to keep this heritageand culture intact For that we need to do
research and for that also we need to propagatethis knowledge and also we can use this technology
to entrepreneurs because most of the technologieseven today are with the poor downtrodden and
the people who are being neglected for yearstogether by the society
And we should Uhh work with them and givethem opportunity too propagation and employment
And let me tell you that this if we can revivethis indigenous technology which are integrated
with the mother nature Uhh it will be notonly helping us to generate wealth but also
it will show the ways and means to modifyour modern life so that it can be integrated
with the Mother Nature and it can be madealso sustainable development and we can also
use this technology and revive it and thiscan maybe adopted by the western people later
on provided we work for it
And that will be the turning point for insteadof follower Uhh than that of a leader In other
words we will became a world leader providedwe keep our tradition and improvise our indigenous
technology which are about to die and workfor it And I wish all the best for all of
you and if some of you could work for thiscause I will be glad and then I will feel
that this effort of making this lecture isfruitful and useful Thank you very much
