Let us start this lecture a thought processfrom Rabindranath Tagore He says that `Trees
are Earths endless effort to speak to thelistening heaven It is a very beautiful statement
and let us recall uh what we learned in thelast lecture We are basically looking at how
the wall being made and various you know wallswe have looked at it and we are discussing
about bamboos And we will now see the rainforce uh you know uh bamboo wall and along
with the mud
And there are as I told like there are severalway of doing this these are the huts and wattle
and daubed is there And wattle are traditionallymade from wood or bamboo or any other like
may be sticks which will be available plentilyin that area And the panels are daubed with
a mud and straw mixture up to the thicknessof 50 to150 mm depending on that This is what
I am showing of course here these are thebamboos right And it can be cane also see
this can be made of cane any other reeds youcan say reeds you can think of and this is
bamboo or cane or any other materials
So advantages if you look at it it is easierto construct and it is cheaper to construct
but needs maintenance It is elegant and finefor seismic zones right and it can be made
only where cane or bamboo is available locallyBasically you need not to really transport
and then you know material and the cost willbe high when you transport here you can have
your own backyard you know you can grow Andas you know that bamboo grows in a two three
years you can have enough bamboos to makeyour house right And even if you take one
bamboo out of the tree it will not it willnot spoil that is the best good part of the
bamboo
And Cow dung and the local vegetable huskand local available grass or straw can be
used and this is been shown here you knowagain this is the thing right And this is
the straw are being used right along withthe mud They can use local materials and this
rice husk has been used this is basicallyrice husk Rice husk is a good insulating material
it is generally applied to the outer layerof the mud plaster because it is water repellent
Even if water will fall on that you know itwill not erode the mud if it is there so that
is why rice husk is been used very much Ofcourse advantages will be similar low cost
cool inside in summer and warm in winter easyto construct good strength due to reinforcement
right and good against vibration particularlyyou know like in earth quake and other reasons
and reasonable durable right if you add thesesaw dust and other local material which will
be there right
And the disadvantages disintegrates if thereis permanent moisture like you know you know
particularly in the coastal areas there mightbe a little problems and wash out in floods
and fire susceptible that is the one bad thingabout but when you use mud it will not affect
that much
So there is a Practice of Natural GeotextileMaterial right in the form of Geogrid or Geonet
kind in ancient India And using the stringof basically coconut coir if you look at this
is the Sanskrit shlokas and I am not goingto read fully but you can say `Narikela Phalacharma
sara jalamapohecha right These are the netswhich are used made out of coirs and the coir
fiber are threaded into strong cords Of coursethis fibre this cord can be 2 to 6 mm and
this is a you know it can be horizontal verticaland other things this is being used in the
earlier days even the fort area so that youknow it will be having you know uh good strength
and then durability also And where sand andslits are only available for constructing
the material not stones where stones are notavailable you can use this right as substitute
And Mud wall is basically ancient techniqueslike because cob what you call some people
will call Cob also Cob is an ancient earthbuilding technique mixing of earth sand gravel
or pebbles slit and straw with little bitwater right and this of course proportionate
is important And if you can see that thereis a I have shown you like this is the mud
wall right Even this house is existing todayin UP I got from one village and if you look
at they are made this very good house andof course there is a little bit cracks here
one has to maintain it And if you look atthe good soil for this wall will be Gravel
around 15 percent sand 50 percent and siltwill be 15 percent clay will be 20 percent
But you know you need not to worry about thismuch this is of course better if you could
get but people will be knowing they can putthis and then then also test it like whether
it is good or not like by hand by their ownjudgment right they will be knowing those
people who are using
But of course most of us we do not know whichis the good or bad or ugly because we do not
have experience but those people are havingalso used the judgement And it is the low
cost of course if available locally rightand less skill is required and appearance
is aesthetic and natural like that is a goodthing And I will show you also how we have
improvised this wall and structural capabilityand heat and sound insulation Of course the
fire and vermin resistance right like if thebecause mud you know is a good you know it
will resist the fire Durability and moistureresistance unlike the bamboo when used and
the other things that will be problematicand it can uh breathability you know like
it can breathe it can also the moisture andair kind of things and less toxic in nature
Because if you look at modern days we usepaints on that and that paints are very very
toxic we do not know and we are not awareabout it and keep the room cool and healthy
And of course disadvantages less bonding betweenthe mud and big pebbles if you are using that
is also problem so you will have to use thepebble proper size of the pebble Not easy
to handle after certain height But if youlook at the history particularly other countries
also like they have used very big houses evenyou know 3 4 floors and then big mosque are
there in Iraq and Iran you can see that andaffected by flood and torrential rain
And let us look at Improvised mud wall rightand this is the improvised mud wall which
you can see here it looks very nice you knowand of course they are using some binding
material here One can use a Portland cementand also one can use lime and other things
I will be uh also talking about compressedwall little later on like you can get also
to the very good strength and stability Andthis is another one this is interior this
is the exterior kind of thing you can havenice things you cannot think of this is made
out of mud this wall right in today So whatI what I want to emphasize not that we will
just look at them but we can improvise itand then use it today right That is the point
we can learn from this lecture and then fromour ancient wisdom
And Mud and Stone composites you can havestone and you can also join together but these
are not size stone it will be any size I haveshown this is also one way but this not good
you should have a proper size and made thenyou can use a mortar mud as a mortar joining
or a binder but low cost if locally availableand less skill required right And disadvantages
less stable against vibrations and other thingshistory of maximum failure during earth quake
because these are not very stable right Butif it is a stone at least it will be stable
Properly stone means stone properly breastand properly placed with certain weight like
your temple structures but these are not liketemple structures And of course for temple
structure there is proper standard is beenmaintained And less bonding between mud and
stone not easy to handle after certain heightbecause These all the problems because these
are all different shape and sizes stones arebeing used so that is not really good one
has to adopt
So let us look at Roofing Material Roofingwill be several kinds Thatched Roofs Bamboo
or wood Roof Stone and Brick Roof Handmadetiles Bamboo corrugated sheets and other materials
There are several kinds you can see and itmay vary from region to region And I will
whatever I am showing is little bit tips ofthe iceberg there are several things are there
in this country and Thatched is one of theoldest form of roofing According to me it
is as old as Indian Civilization And we arewe will see in the afterwards when we talk
about town planning Uh in about that
And this is the one kind of thatched roofyou can see Basically roof of covering made
of dry vegetation like straw if you look atthis are basically straw and palms water reeds
other natural growth you can think of Andit is a very old roofing method has been used
both in tropical and temperate climate likeIndia because it is a good insulation of heat
And is not very popular among the people inrecent time because of two factors one is
that people are very much you know interestedto have a pakka house the you know concrete
and these things and maintenance is very lowvery high in case of thatched house unlike
the concrete And beside this also like todaylabor it is more labor intensive and even
the straws are not available because you knowit is costly
And advantages of course when the it is relatedto agriculture then it is economical light
weight bad conductor of heat But if you wantto buy the straw from the market and then
use then it will be little costlier And alsothe people are not available today to make
this house the skill is not with the peopletoday And disadvantages are fire susceptible
less durable need to change periodically becauseuh in each may be 3 4 years you will have
to change or may be sometimes 5 years Andgood attachment required with ribs so that
it can bear the heavy wind blow
And bas let us look at the basic principleof making a roof making a thatched roof Of
course you need to have a straws and thenit was made of bamboo or the wood and it has
to be done properly and then properly designedto take the load right And this is of course
the carding the straw like if you look outyou will have to separate it put it and this
is the thatching of the roof And thatchedroof must be as simple as possible It should
have ability to adapt free curved shape ofthings kind of things because here is not
shown but suppose you are having you can havethat And a thatched around 80 to 150 thick
wall was used earlier days That dependingupon the your rain and then you know torrential
rain another thing area wise
And average cut length of the straw will bearound 700 mm of course you can manage with
the lower bigger it will be better you knowkind of things the labor cost will be reduced
right And also the here if you look at theit should be have the design of the what you
call these straws will be dependent on thestraw length right because the what you call
the spars will be pushing putting it willbe interval decided by this ok And then the
straw bundle used for roof must be strongsubtle and able to resist efforts to break
it by twisting a handful continuously so thereforepeople use some kind of tight and then put
it If look at this are the poles here thisis a pole right Poles would be around something
50 to 100 millimeters diameter and may bespace around 400 to 800 millimeter apart depending
upon the design of the roof and also the (())(14:28)if it is very heavy then you will have to
take the load of that
And if wall is there wall will take care itbut in some places you do not use the wall
you use the pole right And overhangs theseare the overhangs right it will be around
600 to 1200 mm to protect the mud wall fromthe erosion and direct exposure of the wall
to direct heating from the Sun in summer Andif you look at that depends upon what you
call the area where it is right What is theas I told the path of the Sun taken in the
winter and the summer season has to be takencare
And rain water must not be allowed to dischargefrom a high level of roof to another thatched
roof at a lower level Let me tell you thepeople have designed their houses earlier
days the height of the thatched house in sucha way that you know it will be uh what to
call preventing the Sun summer Sun particularlyto enter into your house one over another
And that is a beautiful thing which I hadseen somewhere and when I inquired they told
this will be like you know when the Sun willmove with the shadow will be coming in another
roof so it will not be heated that much
So let us look at a video how the thatchedhouse can be made you know this is the small
video and this is the straw which is has tobe you now trimmed here This is the bundle
of straw right depending upon the length whatis required which will be dependent on the
what you call distance between two spar rightwhich is not shown here And unfortunately
this kind of people are not there today whoare having school skilled enough to have you
know thatched house so that is the problemtoday
And of course there are several other thingslike coconut leaves roofs are been used particularly
in the coastal belt of the South India Ifyou look at this two storied building like
which having coconut roof here and here theymight be using the may be wood planks or may
be the mud you know house mud roof what willbe having
And mud timber flat roofs if look at it ismost popular in Gangetic plain in UP MP Bihar
even in Jammu & Kashmir you can find and DeccanPlateau and some parts of Karnataka Telangana
Rajasthan and also Central Maharashtra wefind Even it is because I have seen in UP
this kind of mud timber flat roof particularlyrural area And Indian mud roofs are normally
flat with mud bricks on the supporting platformof wooden planks reeds and bamboo matting
palms or even palms or coconut leaves anymatting you can use right mat And sometimes
people use also the brick and mud ok apartfrom your wood planks right
And let me show you a house here this houseis basically something around 40 years old
40 to 50 years old my student who is residingin Trivandrum he told me and he sent this
is his own house in rural area of course andit has been modified later on and this is
the roof is basically mud timber flat roofright And this if look at this the planks
and this is the beam if you look at this isyour beam here and these are wooden planks
kind of things are used And here what willhappen that the mat what you call timber or
the wood plank right this will be uh a kindof thing around 1.5 to 2 inch depending upon
the load what it is coming It may be morethat that this I have shown you typical
And there is a straw mat or may be bamboomat or something given such that it will soak
the any water will be passed through thismud because when the rainy season mud may
absorb some water So these are as far thattimber should not get affected by that right
and this is been used and this life is peoplesays you know around something 100 years And
even some people claim more than that I donot know and I did not get any data Let us
look at what are the advantages of using mudroof over the cemented roof
Mud is truly natural cheap and local materialright and it provides excellent heat insulation
and internal part of the house is cooler insummer and hotter in winter Life is around
100 years of course I have talked with severalpeople I have arrived at these years whereas
the life in cemented roof is around 50 yearsAnd cement you will have to buy from the market
And it is a poor heat you know uh for heatinsulation So and it act as a heat source
You might have observe in your when you areusing the ceiling fan in summer lot of heat
will be coming and they have to put you knowcoming towards uh your the body and from top
to that And it is unfortunate that we areusing that ceiling fan we are basically instead
of cooling our self we are taking the heatfrom the cemented roof and then bringing down
you know it is a foolishness to do that
And we are basically one has to have a ceilingCeiling kind of things right such that this
heat should not come but we are not usingand then after that you use the ceiling fan
right And also the it can be mud roof youknow mud in the mud roof can be recycled so
also the planks and other things and is reusableand concrete can be one time you can use and
you are also it is using a lot of you knowenergy for doing that For mud no need you
will have to use what you call dig and thenuse it you know like or you will have to use
the mud from the ponds or some other placesit cannot be recycled and dismantling cost
is low But concrete house if you want to dismantleit is very high And construction cost is very
low because any ordinary person can do hereyou need especially higher cost of construction
and stronger in compression so far mud isconcerned and so it is very good for the roof
That means mud is a very good material forthe roof whereas the cemented you know crack
may appears if not properly casted and curedproperly and also uh you know cost of construction
of the concrete house or cemented roof isvery high right And of course there will be
disadvantages Mud is eroded easily by waterMud has low strength of course it behaves
poorly in the event of earth quake And ofcourse cemented if you compare it is a good
resistance to earth quake provided you knowit is not with the severe low range you know
Richer scales Richter sorry Richter scalesIf it is low one can manage if it is high
then it will be devastating and high maintenanceis required you know few intervals of you
know after certain intervals of years onehas to maintain the mud roof
So also the concrete also the one can do otherwiseyou know sewage will be a problem And mud
soaks up rain water and becomes heavy andof course cemented roof will not soak the
rain water And mud roof is susceptible tomechanical damage where as the damage due
to the you know mechanical forces in caseof concrete is not that much provided the
load is not that heavy like an earth quakeor a heavy cyclone or landslides you know
this also tend manage The load due to thewhat you call earth quake or heavy cyclone
or the land slide cannot be managed by theeven cement roof
So therefore uh if look at it is having certainadvantages let us look at the bamboo or the
wood or the grass roof kind of things Andthis is the bamboo roofs which is well designed
and then it has to be joined properly alsothese are joints right And it has to be you
know properly maintained so that water canfall on the this thing and this is of course
a uh made of kind of a bamboo also and thisis the one which is made of wood If look at
this is the wood roof and sometimes peopleuse over it brick or may be some mud can also
be use but even you can also use some maton it right on the top of it
And of course these are proven techniquesit is um you know what to call durable particularly
when you use bamboo and other things Bamboosshould be seasoned properly that is also important
And is good strength aesthetically and thengood for Holistic health but creates a environment
good environment inside house you will notfeel you know suffocated while the concrete
or other thing So from that point of viewis good and it is a biodegradable that is
very important one and it is a eco friendlyin the sense it is not guzzling the energy
and creating some in house gases like yourcement and other things you know so also the
uh iron rods
So handmade tiles if you look at people canmake and dry it and even they can bake it
not much skill is required to manufactureInstallation and maintenance does not require
special skill you just keep properly ok ofcourse to some extent skill is required but
not that sophisticated skill is required Canbe manufactured by local soils right and good
for air circulation and never feel suffocatedinside the house and not durable as much as
the concrete but however one can manage upto 10 years you know kind of things what people
are having
And Brick and Lime Roof which is if look atI am showing here that this roof I have got
in nearby IIT Kanpur there is a just adjacentto IIT Kanpur there is a village Nankari I
got this house if you look at this is yourroof If you can see this thing is a arch here
Now this arch is made and it is what the personis claiming it is more than 60 years old this
house and it is not maintained properly letme tell you the it is abandoned they are not
using they are going to dismantle it alsoAnd without maintenance they could manage
to get 60 years ok And which is not in thatbad condition from the look you can see And
there is a another you know question arisesthis arch how it is working If you look at
these are the forces acting on the structuresright And these forces is been transferred
over here right to that and this is a veryimportant stone which is known as the load
stone or the key stone Key brick you can sayhere this will be what you call load brick
right
And the acting forces due to the weight andheat and also the human being suppose you
can have a you know moving around you canhave go for a second storey building it is
result to the compressive stresses in turnsbecause these forces is transferred to this
way this is compressing you know right Andin turn eliminate the tensile stresses here
nearby right it has been joined so the forceis coming and which is also known as the arch
action Because of that it is basically remainingand then of course you can use these kind
of a mortars here or the binders so that itwill remain But how they might have made it
And keep in mind this is a very large archhere this is the very very small arch here
ok What they could have done they would havemade a frame like this before hand right right
And frame of course it could have been a stresskind of thing joining so that load can sorry
load can take right kind of structures rightand then they could have set these bricks
right put it and then of course keep in mindthat these bricks should be of proper size
that is very important And such that at thecenter will be coming to that this center
of you know this thing will be matching withthis radius that is the important point one
has to make right Dig making and putting ita little lot of skill is required and so also
each brick has to be looking at you know thisload whatever it will be coming
And this is the house which you can make brickand lime you know You can make 2 storey building
3 storey building also people have used itAnd there is a another way I happen to see
in Kanpur and this is again in a dilapidatedcondition by the side of Ganga it is in Shivrajpur
This technology is little different this isbasically what you call the vertical the arch
is vertical in nature in this case it is verticalarch This is a horizontal arch if look at
these are all arch horizontal arch right Andhow it is working and then they might have
have a you know frame kind of thing they couldhave used and if look at the center there
will be some center here some other placenot shown here that brick size has to be properly
maintained and kept
So therefore it is very important to whatyou call see that this kind of technology
can be revived such that it can be you knowuse even today and without getting disrupting
to the concrete And the lime is far superioras compared to the Portland cement because
you can make it locally and then you can useit and also from the heat transfer point of
view it is having you know better (pro) propertiesright
And advantages Old technique Durable and usableand it is quite cheap to make it but the skill
you know with which we can make is not availabletoday with the people that is the very important
challenge one has to look at it we can revivethis technology
So there is a Rammed mud wall is a old buildingtechnique it is found in ancient India not
the in the modern way but in a little differentway And it relies only on the natural materials
walls are built of normal compacted mud andtemporary formwork is built into which mud
is placed and compressed to have a compactedwall And let me show you this is the house
which is built out of the compact rammed mudwall right And this is the thing how you can
do like you can have a this frame in whichyou will be ramming this mud and let me show
you that and you are having a mallet hereand these are the frames right which has to
be uh you know supported properly and thenyou can put you know ram it we this frame
is we call it form work right
Of course there will be (())(31:40) levelhere and then you can having And ideal mud
consists of good mix of clay 10 to 40 percentsilt around 10 to 40 percent and sand 30 to
50 percent and very fine gravels but peopledo use in modern time cement even lime can
be used And both weight bearing capacity andnon weight bearing walls can be built of course
when it is wet bearing you will have to increasethe strength right And multi story you know
building can be made out of this providedthe walls are of adequate thickness and minimum
thickness is around 30 cm mainly to allowthe stability and thermal mass Of course 2
3 storey building can be built with increasewall thickness and it is eco friendly and
recyclable and also sustainable
If you look at this kind of technology earlierdays used in fort walls you know particularly
outer walls will be made out of compress uhwhat you call or the rammed mud wall and they
were using elephant for making that you knowto load right So let me show you a video just
to say how it is being done and it is donein modern time in Uttarakhand in some region
And if look at this is the technique theyhave used and this is a two plates here and
one and they are using person is just standingand putting his own load so that you know
he is also pressing it And after this of coursethis is the one pressure you can think of
this handle of the pressure which will beyou know pressed by the both the side of the
formwork of the plank wooden plank so thathe is doing right now so that it will be compressed
right both the vertical compression and thehorizontal compression has to be given so
that it will be take a proper shape and compacted
And they have also made this house themselvesall family members and including the roof
also if you look at this roof this is theroof which is basically made out of mud ok
in recent time It is not the old time theyhave improvised the technology then they have
use it
So you might have seen mud staircase but forme it was a great this thing I could you know
get a mud stair case which is made of theseare the steps right Steps of the staircase
and it is still been used in rural areas ofUP and particularly the poor people who cannot
afford to have a concrete house they are usingtoday And I was having a video may be due
to paucity of time I will not show you Itcan be made with natural material and it is
eco friendly semi skilled people can makeit and of course the more maintenance is required
It will be suitable inside the house and ittakes more space these are the advent disadvantages
And it is suitable for straight staircaselike straight Bu if you want to have a winder
staircase like in modern time due to spacewhat we are using you cannot use it but however
we can really improvise it find out ways andmeans how to do that And it is mostly used
in rural areas like Gangetic Plane UP Biharand West Bengal also to some extent right
And this is the huts in Rajasthan if lookat this particular shape is there and this
we call it as a Wang And this is a very nicedecorated walls they were having that is the
aesthetic sense they are having
And this is the same thing and which is knownas Bhunga houses in Kutch in Gujarat which
is basically in seismic zone And Bhunga housesis traditionally construction type in Kutch
district of Gujarat state which has a veryhigh earth quake risk as I told just now And
it consists of single cylindrical shaped roomright Like this it is a single cylindrical
shape it is not a rectangular shape it isa cylindrical shape And Bhunga has a conical
roof this is like a cone right this roof islike a cone right and supported by cylindrical
walls right these are all cylindrical andBhungas has existed for several hundred years
and is quite durable and appropriate for preprevalent in desert condition This is meant
for desert condition because any side windwill come it will not affect the roof will
be balanced properly you know That is thebeauty of this house
And due to its robustness against naturalhazards as well as its present aesthetics
this housing is also known as Architecturewithout architects right nobody has made people
have made that And it looks very beautifulthat you can see and these are the some other
houses in which are having thatched roofsand we shown and they do always indulge paintings
the walls and other thing And these are alsothe what you call the windows they are having
And the construction of the Bhunga house isbasically as I told you circular in plan with
cylindrical shape so this is basically thecircular in shape and inner diameter of Bhunga
house is typically between 3 meter to 6 meterm right And generally this house will having
3 opening one is the of course the door righthere and there will be windows also another
window two small windows And during earthquake if you look at which happened in the
Bhuj region of Richter scale of 7.6 in 2001it was not really very much affected And as
the record says that very few Bhungas experiencesignificant damage in the epicentral region
which is attributed to the poor quality ofconstruction materials and improper maintenance
of the structure because you need to havemaintain
And why it is so Because due to the circularshape of wall in the plan this is the circular
shape right And inertial forces developedaddition the thick walls required right inertial
forces are developed that in balance eachother and thick walls required for thermal
insulation have high in plane stiffness whichprovide excellent performance under the lateral
loads when the loads are coming it is allbalancing because of circular inside And it
has also been observed that the failure ofBhungas in the last earth quake caused by
the few injuries to the occupants due to thetype of collapse right So this is a very good
house you know which having of course thisthatched house will be having vertical wooden
post which will be there to make it balancekind of things and structural digit
So uh of course the hut style in South Indiawill be little different and these are the
I have shown you like you know different stylesof huts in the rural South India right And
there is a one house I am thinking to discussof course you know each region will be having
different kinds of house design which I couldnot cover in this lecture But however I will
eyes open people to look at it and documentit If possible send to us and take some video
and pictures right of the those houses particularregions
And this is a typical Nylish Tribe House ofArunachal Pradesh and this house floor level
is raised something 2.5 meter from the groundlevel right and ceiling level is around 2.5
meter from the floor level You look at Ifyou look at this height is generally it is
not very strict 2.5 meter it may be varyingbut generally average is 2.5 meter right And
this is around 2.5 meter if you look at thisis the thatched portion over hanks and this
is the V shaped kind of thing used and theseare all what you call foundation you can see
That plan consists of rear verandah righton the back side common room with a fire place
and also very important thing how they makefire in this wooden house
They are all bamboo houses ok It is not havinga floor of mud or some other thing that is
very interesting which I will not be discussingbut it is they know how to do that And like
side verandah there will be lot of verandahsroof is made of bamboo truss and Toko leaves
in that areas palm leaves cane leaves andjungle banana leaves there are several kinds
of leaves they can use And of course the longevityof the improved type of indigenous Nylish
House is about 20 to 25 years But the maintenanceis called for 2 3 years like any other thatched
house And this wooden foundation these arebasically foundations you know gets rut due
to the bacterial action and there is a dangerof structure collapse also the one has to
look at it basically it is required that whatyou call maintenance
If you look at these hill areas they needto have houses like that that is the reason
why they were making and to have a concretehouse in this region is a hell of affair Ok
It is not that ordinary people you need thisand they were knowing how to do that These
houses if you look at this side you will foundationis high because of slope this is a slope right
And they were knowing how to do and this hasto be protected and this you know indigenous
knowledge they will be having Of course thereis a ladder here to you will have to get up
into the house right
And this is the of course various bamboo architecturesI have taken need not to be from our country
but just to show you that bamboo can be agood material
So uh thank you very much Actually I havejust give you glimpses of the housing in rural
areas it is not existing but lot of scienceinvolved and lot of things you can learn from
it and we need to preserve those techniquemethodology and also the skill with the people
And they should find out what they want todo according to their region not that you
know copy and paste the concrete and makeit a concrete jungle So we will have to retain
our heritage and culture of making house anddoing it yourself and taking the all the scientific
aspects into it Thank you very much listeningI hope and wish that you people will do something
and at least record it and preserve it thatis important Thank you very much
