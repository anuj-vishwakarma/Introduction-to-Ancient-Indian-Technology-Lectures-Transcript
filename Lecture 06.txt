Let us start this with a thought process – Ifyou want to realize your potential one must
learn how not to get stopped by others Everyindividual wants to realize his own potential
That is the what our scripture says you willhave to realize your potential and you are
infinite potentially And uhh it is a verygreat thought we should keep in mind and then
start this lecture
Let us recapitulate what we learnt in thelast lecture If you recall that we started
with the chronological Some portion I couldnot cover in the last to last lecture about
particularly from uhh something around 1200AD to 1800 CE because I will be using in place
of ADC that is common era And later on I wentto the Vedic eras and we looked at you know
various parts of the Vedas Upavedas and alsolot of other scriptures
And we looked at one very important thingShilpa Samhita which is having various ways
of uhh whole gamut of the engineering youknow things what we are having
Today what we will be looking at is basicallythat how our ancestors were carrying out not
only the science and other knowledge Theyare harnessing the other knowledge what are
the ways What are the basic principles theyare they were using Can anybody think of
Because if you look at ours is a very greatliving civilization I call Most of the ancient
civilization of other parts of the world isalmost dead but ours is still living It is
about to die because of cultural invasionat this moment We must see that we are alive
and we are having a culture of scientificexploration which is as old as our Indian
civilization It is not that science was notthere Rather science was there it is intermingled
with the spirituality
We never had a quarrel between the religiousleaders and the scientist like a…unlike
in western part of the (coun) world We arehaving all altogether That is the samrasata
that means you know same balance they werehaving And the method of harnessing the scientific
knowledge or any other form of knowledge hasits deep roots It is very…And if you look
at you will find that the modern way of doingscience is similar if not same
So you will be knowing most of them but Iwill talking about that in…If you look at
this is total the ways of doing is basicallypratyaksha-anumana-agama- arthapatti and pramana
I think this terminology some of you mightbe aware Pratyaksha means what Pratyaksha
means is basically perceptions right Whenhow you will perceive
It can be external It can be internal rightWhat do you mean by external perceptions How
you will perceive a thing What are the basictools you are endowed as a human being to
do that What are those things
Student: Through what we call about senseslike a…
Professor: Senses
Student: Yeah
Professor: We call in Hindi or in Sanskritindriyas you know There is total 10 indriyas
uhh karmendriyas and jnanendriyas right Karmendriyameans hand you know leg and then anus and
then you know like genital these are all karmendriyasThat this thing like your eyes ears uhh skins
right and nose these are all sense organsSo by that you will basically get the perception
by these five senses for the worldly objects
If I want to see I want to observe in modernscience you want to do you will have to do
that with that help Of course nowadays youcan have technology to aid your senses That
is all But senses is the ultimate thing fora human being to perceive to get the ideas
right
But there is also internal perception Internalperception you know you can think of mind
In Indian sense mind is very vast thing Ido not want to get it right Like you might
be knowing ahamkara buddhi chitta right Andmanas these are all part It is a very whole
kind of concept Mind is not only mind OkayThat is a western way of looking at But ours
is a very profound thought process or theway of understanding
So I will not get into that but I will tellyou that inner sense…these are the external
sensors what we are having Inner sense I callit as a basically intuitive power intuition
And the intuitive power man is endowed notanimal and that cannot be…can be harnessed
if you follow our ancestor way of teachingUnfortunately we are not We must do that and
the modern method of teaching or the you knoweducation is far away from getting the intuitive
knowledge
I am not going to discuss that here but howeverintuitive knowledge is very important and
once has to integrate it with the Mother Naturethen only you can get the intuitive power
And that is being you know…has to be utilizedfor harnessing the science to understand discover
to find out And another way of doing is anumanawhat we call inference Inference if you look
at it is basically you want to draw some conclusionsbut those conclusions which should have prior
knowledge also That we call as a inference
And uhh of course you may have some observationconnect to the previous one whatever you are
having then connect it that we call inferenceAnd in loosely one can say interpretation
We do interpret And that we do in our sensethat is anumana And it is very important to
use your mind to have inference People donot have time to think and then what about
they will do inference drawing They need mindto do that
So in modern way although we are using technologybut we do not have peace of mind to think
and draw inference conduct experiment Youneed perseverance You need also good what
you call patience to do that Scholarship cannotbe obtained in a hurry You want to be scholar
you will have to be patient right And lotof things
So therefore the another way of doing is agamameanings that whichever is coming down from
the previous generation you need to learnthat and also understand that That does not
mean something wrong you will have to acceptbut you will have to check verify it and then
only you can say that is agama It is a traditionalknowledge what is coming up What happened
in India like you know with this western orthe modernity we lost all our things We should
not Even right now also we are losing ourtraditional knowledge at an alarming rate
We should try to look at what there and ourancestors were having We should take care
of that and understand in a modern way Notthat we will have to you know be in that no
The whole what you call world is in motionthat will be there also It was there thousand
years is in motion right Flow continuum todayalso It will be there after thousand years
but we need we will have to keep continuityContinuity lost means you are lost Am I right
or wrong
Continuity has to be maintained So thereforewe need to look at traditional knowledge and
do that And this is the agama is also traditionyou know you will have look at Do not throw
that tradition because it is old no You are…youcannot afford to do that So therefore we need
to look at and those things you can use alsofor your way of interpreting or the this thing
Then the arthapatti means a postulation Ifyou look at the word postulation and inference
it is almost similar it is not same So whythere is another word Can anybody tell me
Postulation means you (po) you know postulatesomething you say something like you guess
that what it would be right What would bethe model But then what is a difference Can
anybody tell me
Difference is that in this case you get thispostulation from a circumstances from the
evidence present You are not taking the helpof earlier knowledge It is not that something
on your back of mind and then you are tryingto connect and guess No it is very raw new
So therefore that is arthapatti If you lookat the what they are having right Even in
modern time we do not have that clarity
I am sure most of you may not be having AmI right But they were having right It is I
am giving you tips of iceberg you know thereis a lot more to that So it is not that only
you will inference only you will speculateonly postulation No you will have to have
proof And we call it pramana So proof meansproof can be done various ways You can have
you know like somebody has told and you aregetting experience it is a proof
You can conduct experiment and prove Thereis a certain hypothesis is being talked about
The another fellow also think that way Youknow like there is a various way of – you
can give a logic and then prove from someother places like that we do in mathematics
right Prove various ways So therefore we alwaysbelieve in proof So this is the beauty of
the ancient science and also the technologyby which you know by the method by which they
were harnessing the ancient science and technology
It is not that you know believe somethingsuperstitious no So therefore you should think
that they were doing And as I told you thebasic principle and you should use these principles
also for harnessing modern science and whateveryou do It is not only science for any other
knowledge as a matter of fact It should notbe somebody has told and then you will believe
no You will have to experience you will haveto interpret You are a human being You know
you are having a…you want to garner theknowledge So therefore this has to be followed
So if you look at ancient India was a landof sages saints seers as well as land of scholars
and scientist As I told earlier the Bharatis Bha means knowledge Rat means jo involve
or indulge or doing harnessing the knowledgeThat is Bharat Always we are having a knowledge
society Okay The amount of knowledge whatwe have gathered what we have given is enormous
Today we are not because we are followingthem blindly right
Then how can we do that We can do only whenyou are having own and then you think independently
and of course you can learn from other Sotherefore ancient India’s contribution to
science and technology includes lot of thingI will be giving a very short overview of
that
Mathematics we are very good in mathematicsalthough some of you will be frightened by
the mathematics today And as I told that conceptsof zero is a great contribution to the world
The techniques of algebra algorithm squareroots cube roots and then you know like the
calculus is from this place lie in the India500 years before the Leibnitz and Newton could
think of But unfortunately in our school andcolleges that has been not talked about it
It is very unfortunate
We should tell to our kids to our youngstersthat we our people were doing And we must
do that We should come to their level So whatI was telling that this is the things what
is very important
For example the uhh if I sayif I ask peoplethe numeral systems for example I I means
what 1 II means 2 right Or III means if Iwrite it down…right I what is I I basically
1 right II I call…right III…okay IV 4So if you look at this is one (num) numeral
system There is another right This is anothernumeral system What you call this one Roman
numeral What is this numeral systemStudent: Indo-Arabic
Professor: Indo-Arabic right But very fewpeople will be knowing that that is Indian
From India it is originated When we are akid it was known as Arabic numerals But now
worldwide it has been accepted But my youngfriends they do not know We must tell to our
people “Look! We are the people who areour ancestors…we are means our ancestors
have developed very beautiful numeral systems”Right We should feel proud of it
Not only proud of it but do something forour country and also the world Am I right
or wrong So therefore lot of things we shoulduhh I mean I have to convey I have to do that
and communicate to the our youngsters Thatis the reason why I am taking so much of pain
of doing this ancient Indian technology courseSo you may not…may be aware Sulba-sutra
which was very long time back even like youknow I have already given uhh and they were
having solution of quadratic equation whatyou use in your uhh school times
You know in the school it is being taughtBut we never told it is from the Sulba-sutra
right So also the permutation combinationirrational numbers as I told calculus several
other thing You will be surprised to knowthat we use binary numbers In computers modeling
binary number is being used and it was therein our country by Pingala Chanda-sutra from
something 1500 to 1000 BC before Common EraBefore Common Era you know from the Christ
onwards is known as Common Era
And before that BC you call before CommonEra That means you know if 1500 around 2000
3000 500 years back you know Are you gettingBut that was not meant for computer application
It was meant for prosody Prosody means youknow poetry chanda like I mean I will have
to make it that way And it was meant for spiritualright Our main base was that and you can see
in Meru Prastara and other thing But…
And if you want to look at this referenceyou can see this Ganita-sara-sangraha by Mahaviracharaya
800 CE Common Eras So if you look at mathematicswas considered to be the very important subject
in ancient India but today our students aregetting frightened by mathematics Few might
say “Oh! It is difficult” And it is youknow like they feel a very shy about it Why
I am saying because it was used in VedangaJyotisha This shloka I am taking from that
in around 1200 BC says “Yatha shikha mayuranamnaganam manayo tath yatha Tadvad vedangshastranam
ganitam murdhinam sthitam”
What is the meaning of that Meaning is thatlike the crest of the peacock like the gem
on the head of a snake so is the mathematicsis head of all the knowledge Mathematics is
very important for propagating the knowledgeWhy Why it is so Actually let me tell you
our ancestors were aware that mathematicsis the language by which you will express
the science You will be making it compactYou will do manipulation calculation
You know the way the what you call uhh languagehelps us to develop our mind you know you
are aware or not Because our language is veryscientific It helps to develop the intellectuality
the power of the mind not the English whatI am using okay It is Sanskrit is the best
language Any other Indian language will begood because they are scientific Similarly
mathematics helps to develop the mind andalso to communicate well right
That is why mathematics is important and hehas given…they have given…they had given
the importance since you know like what youcall some 3000 years back even So let us 
look at another shloka I am taking “Chaturdhikamshatmashtagunam dwashshtitatha sahstranam
ayutdwaya vishkamay aasnno vruttaparinah”Who gave this This shloka is basically from
Aryabhata I around 476 CE Common Era And whatis the meaning of that
That means he is saying add four to one hundredmultiply by eight then add sixty two thousands
then divide it by the twenty thousand resultis approximately circumference of a circle
diameter by twenty thousand By saying so whatis he trying to say Do you know Can anybody
guess It is the…
Student: Value of Pi
Professor: Value of Pi See how they have putthis thing in a very what you call simplified
way and a language or a like a poem a stanzaof a poem That means the literature it was
very profound in expressing the thing So andit is one example I have given There are several
examples I will not be really discussing allof them but I will be showing later on how
the people were good in communicating or whatyou call in a little complex way If you look
at it is a complex way It is not that easy
So I will give another very instances wherecryptically people have talked about it So
therefore when you say that what is this thenyou know we will we will lose amidst Let us
say this is the shloka like “Gopibhagyamadhuvrat shungashodadhi sandhigah khaljivitkhatava
galhala rasandhar” If you look at this shlokais basically talking about Krishna Shri Krishna
Gopibhagya means you know gopi jo hai unkabhagya hai vidhata hai raja hai You know like
he is a controller But is it really so Thatwe will look at
To unravel that we will have to go the KatapaydiSamkhya Katapaydi Samkhya you some of you
may be aware That earlier days what they giveThey give a letter to a number ka is 1 kha
is 2 ga is 3 gha is 4 gna is 5 cha chha jajha right And ta tha da dha na it goes that
way And pa pha ba bha ma ya ra la va sha haand kshah So if you look at if I say ga ga
means what 3 Pa pa means what 1 And if I saybha means What is bha Can anybody tell me
Bha is 4
So if you go on putting that thing you will…afterthat 5 okay You will find the value of Pi
which is correct up till the last digit Canyou please count how many are there If you
are having calculator you can check The numberis correct till the last but one digit So
if you look at what a wonderful thing! Andwe do not know how to decipher it you know
Are you getting There is a lot of things andwe lost a lot of things Something has gone
we do not know
So therefore you know like lot of scholarsparticularly from Arabian countries when they
started taking our thing they were startledThey say “Why these people are doing that
(())(22:10) complicated” So and that thethat also needs a level of thinking level
of expressing it you know It is not easy tothink and do that So there is a lot of things
which which are not connected but disconnectedbecause history we lost a lot of thing because
of invasion because of thousand years of foreignrule you know you can say
And today also we are in that that colonialmind or the that slavery mindset We have not
come up Hope that you people will do welland come up
So uhh of course the Einstein I consider himhe is one of the greatest scientist so far
this world has produced And what he says Hesays that we owe a lot to to the Indians who
taught us how to count without which no worthwhilescientific discovery could have been made
And he is confessing but whether we have thatfeel
If we do not have feel that then we cannotreally progress because you should have conviction
that our ancestors were good and we need togo beyond them That is important right Then
only we will be driving So with this motivationI would suggest that you please think about
it and do well and see that all your potentiallywill come out of you and you will be useful
to the not only yourself for the society forthe world at large
So if you look at the physics generally comesfrom the metaphysics in India particularly
you know And you can…all aspect like mechanicsmatter magnetism and optics I will be not
talking very detail but however I will givetry to glimpses of that
For example if you look at mechanics thisis a shloka I will not recite it “utkhepan
prakshepan kunchan prasaran gamnani panchakarmani” Karmani means basically is a motion
like five kinds of motion: upward downwardcontraction expansion locomotion So similarly
let me now talk about that from the Vaisheshikwhich is something 500 BC And there is a ‘Veg
(sankar) Sanskaar’ sutra Veg means veg meansvelocity basically kind of thing you can think
of gati and describe the action of forcesparticularly mechanical forces there might
be electrical forces
So veg nimitta visheshata visheshaat karmanojayate means change in motion occur due to
applied force If you look at what is thisCan anybody tell me Newton’s second law
But is it being taught to us No naa Newtonhas told and this is 500 BC right
So veg nimitta pekshat karmano jayate niyatdik kriyaprabandhan hetu that means change
in motion is directly proportional to theapplied force and is in direction of applied
force right So it is more clear now that isthe second law
And veg sanyog vishesh virodhi action andreaction are equal and opposite in direction;
that is your third law of motion And karanatbhavat karyabhah there is a little problem
there can be no cause without effect RightThat means something is there to have effect
But there is another thing na tu karyabhavatkaranabhavat that means it cannot be stated
that there is no cause even if there is noeffect right He is saying that but again he
is qualifying what should be you know
So what I am saying like we need to studythese things I mean these as bits and pieces
One has to relook at and look at from theperspective of what they were having We are
looking at from the perspective or the eyesof the western the way look We need to look
at both the eyes it will be good so that youknow we can get the better perspective than
what our ancestors were having also right
So this portion that is what you call forceand other things what we have discussed is
from the Vaisheshik but the five kinds ofmotion we have taken from Tarkasangraha Chapter
1 and then Annambhatta
So similarly elasticity I will not uhh discussabout the shloka recite which is little complex
you may not get also Of course some of youmay be knowing Sanskrit well Ye ghana nibidah…it
goes on That elasticity is the property ofa body That all of all of us experience you
know like and also we have studied in ourscience you know school and colleges It can
be sheared by deforming forces can get backto its original state And this is Nayakandali
by Sridharacharya in 991 CE So if you lookat we are having something
So similarly magnetism or the matter likethey call bhramaka chumbaka chaiva karshan
dravakam tatha…it goes on So five typesof magnets were there in ancient India: Bhramakam
Chumbakam Karshakam Dravakam Romakantam Sothese are varieties they have talked about
and they are single-faced double-faced four-facedfive-faced multi-faced And each is again three
colors It can be yellow black or red kindof thing If you multiply all these thing there
will be several varieties of magnet you knowthey were aware
So uhh if you look at like we have now discussedabout basically what are the basic principles
of the methodology how we can carry out thescience or any scientific knowledge we can
harness Beside this we have looked at thewhat are the mathematics little bit you know
glimpses I have given And now we are discussingabout physics part portion
And I will stop over here And then we willbe discussing the next lecture some portion
of the physics and chemistry and then someother things And then we will go on seeing
even looking at games what kind of games ourancestors had devised So we will do that in
next lecture Thank you very much
