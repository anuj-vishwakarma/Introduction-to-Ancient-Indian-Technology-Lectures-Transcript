I welcome this all of you to this lectureand let us have a thought process before starting
this lecture And we should keep in mind thatagriculture is the only primary wealth of
human kind it is not only for India aloneok that spins other firms of secondary wealth
but unfortunately in the name of modernitypeople are not giving importance to agriculture
today But that is the primary wealth and whichnature gives us Mother Nature gives us
So we should you know concentrate on thatand I must say you that if you want to be
Rishi that means sage you have to do KrishiRishi banana ke liye krishi karna zaroori
hai that means if you want to be a good humanbeing you will have to get a task to the agriculture
farming gardening all those things is important
So that you can understand the Mother Naturethat is why our ancestors were giving importance
to the agriculture and question arises asI told the soil is important and then a question
arises what do you mean by soil
Soil is basically mixture of small rock particlesdebris and organic materials like which you
call humus right and which develops on theearth surface and support the growth of plant
As I told earlier this humus comes from themicro-organism and this micro-organism will
be working all the time for you know theirlife and those thing they will be died and
then they will be having lot of minerals otherthings will be coming from their bodies and
then that will be helpful for our thing inthe name of modernity and scientific understanding
modern I am criticizing that
So we have started using fertilizers and (())(2:20)and also pesticide insect that spoiling the
humus you know micro-organism is working forus why should we you know use those things
there is no need but only thing that ratherto support them and that is the reason also
why you should not deal you know depth wisemore depth wise by using the tractors using
the brutal force rather the use the ploughand then of course that angle of the plough
share is very important
And what are the kinds of Indian soils youare aware if you look at any idea There you
must have studied and I had also told youin the earlier lecture Let me repeat again
One is Alluvial soils but question ariseshow I will identify Alluvial soils Alluvial
soils is basically comes from the river bedyou know it will be occurring in the river
bed and it is carried by the river itselfand then some of the (hu) humus and other
things will be carried with that and it willbecome and from the colour you can know and
it will be colour will be yellow I will showyou some picture later on
The Black soil Black soil is basically arisesfrom the volcanoes and then your their material
which will be coming during the volcanoesand it will be containing Manganese and the
things but unfortunately it will be containingless organic matter but Alluvial soil will
be containing lot of organic material whichis required for the cultivation like and this
Alluvial soil will get in Gangetic plainsthe river beds nearby I will show you that
where we are getting in it
And Red and Yellow soils which is basicallylaterite you know sediments of the laterites
stones which are there in Tamil Nadu and otherDeccan areas and then your in Odisha and then
Bihar some portion and Laterite soil is anotherone where Iron it will be containing more
Iron and the Aluminium right
And Arid soils which is been in the desertarea will be getting from the containing sand
and also it will be containing less amountof organic matter
And Forest/Mountain soils always will be youknow containing lot of organic materials and
also some portion of minerals kind of things
If you look at this is the forest and mountainsoil what you will be getting in Kashmir and
then Himachal Pradesh and some portion ofnorth is this region right and these are roughly
you may get in some other places as well thisone but roughly we are saying And this is
your Alluvial Gangetic plains you know theseare your you know some portion of Bihar and
other things this portion also you know thisportion are Alluvial soil And the red and
yellow this region is yellow will become youknow when the Iron s less so that is the what
will having right and this region and thenlike even some portion of Madhya Pradesh some
portion of Odisha Andhra also some portionand of course the Tamil Nadu and some portion
here in this region
And Black soil you will get in Deccan Plateaueven in Tamil Nadu this middle portion you
know this portion is black kind of thingsthis will be Black soil and of course the
Laterite you will get here very small portionwhere are the mountains will be there of Laterite
stones and then those are the places of courseI have also told you that this in these regions
right you will get these portions And Aridsoils you will get here in Rajasthan area
in some portions in the coastal side alsoyou will get Arid regions right
Now from the colour you can get this is basicallywhich soil it would be it will be Alluvial
soil right and the Black soil of course isfrom colour you can see right it is a black
soil and do not think that soil will be thatblack but you know like in some places it
will be a little whitish also I mean likeless black rather I cannot say this is the
soil the red and yellow soil which will begetting in this region you know this region
Red and Yellow Yellow you will get only whenthe Iron content will be less right in the
soil
And these are Laterite soils right Lateriteis a stone what is being used being the less
compressed you know stone you can say and(Lat) and this is about basically Arid soils
right and this is your Forest or Mountainsoil So from this colour and combination you
can see this is of course the modern way ofclassifying the soil But let us see now how
our ancestors were classifying the soil whetherthey were having any understanding or not
right
So before that let us look at the farm landwhich is also known as Kehtra in Sanskrit
in or in Vedic culture right it can be dividedinto 3 categories Urvara Urvara means fertile
from the farming point of view Anurvara meansbarren land right the other is Krsya Krsya
means arable land right which can use forpurposes but however agriculture we have to
give you know irrigation you will have touse irrigation you have to give water
Nature of soil: If you look at this is a Sarkarameans basically salty and sikata it will be
sandy and Asman means basically stony therewill be lot of stones kind will be there that
is and of course there are several you knowtext or the scriptures are there on them is
Amarakosa and which it talks about differentkinds of land like we call it bummi that is
soil Mrtsna that is basically Mrtsna meansbasically are maru is a region of devoid of
water right and Usa means salt ground rightof course and Usara a spot with lime you know
lime soil will be there that is known as thatmeans salt and lime are different things you
know Usa and Usara
And Maru actually as I told you is a regionof devoid water and Mrtsna is excellent soil
that is the Mrtsna soil is an excellent oneright And Khila are the are also known as
Aprahata is waste land that means you knowwhich cannot be really used for cultivation
and Nadvan Kumudvan and Sadvala like thatmeans you know like these are the lands which
is having different purposes like reeds waterlilies ratnas or green grass this is known
as grass land kind of things you can say rightwill be there
And Pankila that is a muddy soil if the soilis muddy and the water is there it becomes
mud kind of things and very fine soil structurethen call Pankila Anupa means land adjoining
to water is known as Anupa right And SarkaarilaSarkaarila means stony soils and Siktila sandy
soils of course very Sikta Siktila right isadjective basically Some of these words can
be found in Vedic literature also but I havetaken some of the words different you know
defining different kinds of land that wordif you look at they are having a varieties
kind of things we will see as you go on
And in ancient India land were generally classifiedinto 3 categories Jungala I mean where you
will be having dry or arid land where youwill not use for cultivation you keep as it
is right for veget you know kind of thingsvegetation There is Anupa wet land where lot
of water and other things will be there whichwill be also will not be using for cultivation
Sadharana moderate moisture on the basis ofmoisture content And these categories is basically
based on the what Moisture content becausemoisture is very important for the cultivation
right
And that is thing which is they had identifiedwhere as we are saying the water is important
no what moisture in the what in the soil isimportant for cultivation that is the understanding
they were having and modern is water
So that is not really that right thing butone has to look at it we will have to look
at whether it is right or wrong But I thinkin I had a discussion with some agriculturist
they are saying that is the right that moisturecontent in the soil is important rather than
the water And there is a also a book you canread The Straw of Revolution that is known
by the Hukwaka and in which he says that youneed not to give that much of water for the
rice which is well known I mean we and thatis you do not need you can cultivate the rice
with a very less amount of water I mean ofcourse one has to look at the arguments and
he has proven it in his by his cultivation
And further classification according to theSusrutsamhita based on their odour colour
and taste if you look at they are classifyingin three ways One is you know according to
the colour right which we had seen just nowbased on that colour like Alluvial soil and
then Red and yellow soil Black soil is basicallyfrom the colour you can get But they are classifying
six that is Asita-Black and Vipandu thereis a pallid or the dull basically this is
a Lateratic profile Laterite means Lateritestone and that profile right that colour
And Syamala dark blue this I do not know wherethey got this thing and I have not seen also
this dark blue colour soil okay but they aresaying I do not know Lohita of course it is
there and Sita is white white means may bethis is little bit less yellow Pita is yellow
and Sita is there saying white in Englishbut according to me it will be less yellow
colour you know are the kind of thing thatmay you call Sita
So if you look at all are matching exceptthis Syamala let dark blue may be I am not
an expert in this soil so maybe it will bethere I do not know you can look at it So
six types of soil according to the taste nowthat taste also people are talking about you
know like we really think about in moderntimes of course we are having lot of instrument
to check the soil quality or the things
So therefore we may not but they are havingtheir own test and they can test the soil
and say which is what Madhura that is thesweet Amla the sour and the Lavana is the
saline right and tikta is pungent smell andkatuka is acrid kind of things and Kasaya
is astringent right This is a you know 2 34 5 6 6 types of soil tests they can do you
can depending on that you can change your
And there is another ancient scriptures Vrkshyayurvedahas a separate section on bhuminirupana bhuminirupana
means identifying a land you know for describingall kind of classification of soils so that
you can put the crop depending on the kindof land you are having it is not that you
will just do whatever you like you know likethe way we are doing even if it is not that
area is for the rice but we are cultivatingrice there you know because of these things
So that is not one should not do that oneshould have a knowledge about the soil that
is important point what I am trying to telland which was there in ancient time as well
The soil with poisonous matter stones ant-hillssaline and then gravely or deep underground
waters are not favourable for trees of coursefor plantation you can do because in the tress
the roots will be getting into deep into thething so therefore these are the things which
of course the poison matter is there meansyou should not really even have a crop
The Sadharana or moderate soil is appropriatefor all kind of trees that is but in todays
(())(15:45) Sadharana means you know likeyou will say general so in it is useless you
will say but in otherwise this is the Sadharanameans it will be used for everywhere And Varahamihira
who has written a book on that like this regardsthe soft mrdevi right to be good for all kinds
of tress emphasize the need for preparationof soil before sowing the seed that he has
the Samhita he has talked about it
That first preparation of the land is to sowthe seed sesasum like you know there is a
another way of improving the soil qualityhe is saying first you sow a sesamum in the
soil and when they grow have put forth flowersright sesamum trees this thing and they are
uprooted that is according to BrahatsamhitaBrahatsamhita is basically I think written
by Varahamihira Brahatsamhita and so he saysthat And what is this sesamum Any idea That
is what we call in Hindi Til right I willbe showing some pictures for that in the next
slide
And there is a Vrksayurveda in that like thebig trees you know are they have also classified
the trees big trees means Vanaspati treesmeans druma Latha-creepers thickets gulma
and mentions three ways of planting them byseeds See how you can have a plant Because
you you can use the seeds you can use alsothe scion of a plant or the kanda right Basically
if you look at in modern times we are callingit a tissue culture ok that was there also
that time you might be aware that tissue cultureyou know you will take some and sculp it out
and then put some chemicals and then put thisthing and then wrap it with a cotton and other
things so that you will get a tree get a plantout of a this thing
So that is a basically modern time tissueculture we call and bulbous roots or the kanda
like your ginger if you take right or someother things you can use for the its propagation
And Varahamihira mentions that certain treeslike Ashoka rose-apple plantain pomegranate
or draksha etc grows form the scion and notfrom the seeds That means these trees they
were knowing that which way to be grown fromwhich way has to be grown that is being they
were knowing they have mentioned these things
And showing them in a proper manner of coursemodern people like us we do not know those
things and it is very important for us knowthat And the scions are plastered with the
mud right and mud and then they some peopleuse also gobar I had seen when I was a kid
I had gone to some village and they were usinggobar and paste gobar means in the cow dung
cow dung and the mud they will be puttingit and then using it and there is a various
other what you call ingredients they do adddepending upon the locality
So Milindapanho that is the basically Buddhisttext it is a if you recall that is a dialogue
between a king and a Buddhist monk and impliesthe knowledge about seeds has two main parts
he says selection of good seeds that is veryimportant which is good or bad a person should
have a knowledge how to decide And sowingthem in a proper manner right that is also
very important what he has emphasized andkeep in mind that what he has told that all
seeds do not germinate due to inherent defectsand each you know each seed has to be separated
if it is having you knows defects
Now how to identify the thing this requiressome experience right You will have to by
the observation may be you will have to sowput in a water and then then you will have
to see whether it is floating if it is floatingit is not good quality you know there is several
ways of doing that
Now those things of course one has to learnand then record it also I mean it might be
recorded in the earlier scriptures But I knowthat some people were having those knowledge
when I was a kid in village particularly Buttoday that knowledge has gone with the wind
of the time you know like that knowledge arenot there and if it is not been coded or recorded
properly then you know we lost that knowledgeAnd those are knowledge were there with a
lot of people today you know it may be therelying in some book So it is important to the
knowledge with the people than that of insome book or some person you know some specified
persons you know
The parched grains as the seeds are unfitto germinate as per the Mahabharath You know
what is this parched grain Any idea that meansthe grain which will be boiling it and again
dry it that is basically parched grain right
And Arthashastra which was written by Kautilyaor the Chanakya which is a very important
scriptures and which is left with the plenderof the invaders you know left intact so that
is a good thing that mention the collectionof the seeds in the appropriate time the time
is important right
Yathakalam that means you know like kalammeans is basically time as the first duty
of the superintendent of agriculture therewas at that time superintendent of agriculture
who will be see that it is being done andit has his job was to educate the people as
well right who should collect all kinds ofgrains flowers roots creeper fruits flax and
cottons and also keep as a seed bank Todaywhere is the seed bank Each village were having
earlier days But today we will be buying theseeds from the companies which is from outside
and they will be you know taking a lot ofmoney from the pockets of the farmers and
that is why farmer is committing suicide
Because everything is costly everything hehas to buy you know he is not independent
he is dependent on the market And also themost if you look at most of the seed companies
are from outside today and they are havingmonopoly over that and we do not have our
own seeds you know that is the sad part ofour deposited should be there And it should
be also you know be with the people as wellnot only with the government alone To increase
the fertilizer seeds they were also treatedbefore sowing right their method this has
to be also tested I will be talking aboutthat but I I feel that people might not have
tested those thing in modern times
So according to the Krisiparasara seeds arenot to be kept on an ant hills right or the
cow shed or a delivery room You might be knowingfor delivering baby earlier days we are having
a separate room It is not that you will takedeliver in a room which is a living or a deliver
a baby in some hospital earlier days okayIt was separate and that is very important
I will not talk about it why it is importantthat tradition the tradition is very important
according to me I have tried to interpretit little bit
And why it is so This question this you knowseeds are not to be kept on these but why
We need to understand It is not that theyhave written we will follow it no right So
therefore one has to look at it because therewill a lot of bacteria other things here which
will be affecting therefore they might havedone but more studies is required to prove
that that is right And unfortunately we arejust saying it is not out dated but we should
to understand with the modern science also
The seeds should not contact with the remnantfoods women with the menses lamp fires smoke
and rain right So with this they have thereis a restriction they should be kept out So
these must not be stored in a pit or undergroundright You should not store that but why Why
you will not store There are various reasonsone can think of if you go to underground
the moisture content will be different andmay be it will be not enough air and then
these things and there might be some fungusdevelopment temperature may be low right So
all those things has to be there one has tolook at understand it
As to Arthashastra the seeds of grain areto be soaked in dew and dried in the heat
for seven days right why Of course it is awhy they are using dew Dew you know like in
the particularly in the night time there willbe dew which will be there in the leaves that
has to be collected what will condense youknow and those water has to be used why Why
not simple water Because those will be whatyou call already evaporated and condensed
back So it is pure or quality will be improvedto that they were knowing this required
And dried in the heat of course it is notthe heat rather I will say they do not do
the dry in the sun directly but they willbe using the heat from the sun Generally nowadays
you will find on the road or some people villagersare drying the what you call grains on the
sun shine on the direct sun but that was notthere earlier days because people are not
having that knowledge that you should notdry that Therefore we are having attic systems
where the on the floor you know of the housethere will be a place where on the top of
the floor and then you will dry there withthe shed right in the shed you will be drying
So those pulses for 3 days and nights okaythis is what I am saying seed of grains is
for the seven days where as seed of pulsesfor 3 days and nights why These questions
have to be looked at it you know So with thisI will stop over and we will discuss about
also how to take care of various seeds andsowing methods in the next lecture thank you
very much
