Let us start this lecture with a concept whichare built into our psyche that is ‘panchamahabootha’
Of course it is a space fire air water andearth we are now discussing about water How
to preserve it how to conserve it how to useit sparingly so that it will be you know can
be utilised properly and without spoilingits quality And in the last lecture we discussed
about various reservoir systems for irrigationand also we looked at various kinds of canals
or the channels were being built by our ancestorsfor taking care of water needed for both for
the cultivation and also for the drinkingToday we will be talking about how they were
controlling basically flow of the water fromthe river and also from the reservoirs
They were using the sluices Sluices are basicallydevices in the form of gate or valves through
which water flow can be regulated well Ofcourse this is the modern way of doing but
in the ancient days people were using thatIf you look at generally this is the embankment
which is being placed and then of course therewill be some this is made of generally earth
or the soil and then there will be structuremachinery kind of things and there will be
water which is body is coming in And therewill be some line tunnel which will be there
right
And this will be the sluice gate which isto be basically placed and it can be controlled
in such a way that you can have flow throughthis channel or the tunnels which is there
to the downstream in the distributary channelor some other channels And generally this
sluice are little bit kept away from the upstreamembankment and the distance is very important
for its life and also for its updations andthose knowledge were there with them because
we find lot of evidences of uses of sluicegates in ancient India
Sluices are generally installed at the pointof maximum water depth and quite far from
the embankment as I told earlier And as Itold earlier sluices were known to ancient
even before pre historic period because inSanskrit it is known as ‘udakabandhu’
and tumbu in Tamil Tubu in Kannada and Tumusin Telugu are the names for sluice gates found
in ancient inscriptions And Sangam literatureof the south and later Pandya’s records
indicate number of construction of sluicesto river channels and small reservoirs around
the Madurai
The same tradition of building reservoir sluiceswere continued by the Pallavas and Cholas
also People were doing how to do and it wasa group of people who were expert and then
doing that And as I told earlier there werecommittees for controlling the sluices and
maintain the sluices in the I think 2-3 lecturesback And the Viraman tank built by Chola Paranthaka
1 around 950 AD was having something 74 sluicesAnd this was built at the fag end of Kaveri
delta
So these are all evidences you know whichare you know historically found and of course
some of them were not being known to peopleand Colagangam reservoir by Chola Rajendra
1 was having several sluices and channelsfor irrigation of a larger area Let us look
at like you know how they were making thesesluice gates generally the dressed granite
slabs laterite blocks and plank of trees evenlike were used for making sluices And ropes
were used for opening and closing the sluicesCoconut fibers and then jute fibers were used
for making ropes The size of a sluice in SiragaliTanjavur district was found to be around 89
cm wide and 20 cm breadth
And Head Sluice which is basically known asMukha-vay in Tamil It is a short water regulator
made of strong masonary work usually placedat points where the canals takes off from
the river or a tank The Head of water it isgenerally constructed above the head sluices
which a large mouth through which the excessflow of water will be transmitting that can
enter into the canal from the main sluiceAnd Massive Head sluice is basically made
of a solid granite block which was built byChola Kolottunga 3 around 1205 AD and it is
really very remarkable native engineeringwork which is still in good condition for
supplying water to Tiruchirapally town fromUyyakondam channels that branched off from
Kaveri near the Vettuvayttalai railway station
If you just analyse these things and alsomost of the surviving reservoirs built during
the early Pandyas around something 700 to800 CE have stone sluices The position and
the depth of these sluices were very accuratesuch that they were providing the very least
amount of silt level Because you might beaware that wherever we place a sluice there
is more chances that silt will be depositedthere due to the slow motion of the fluid
stagnation with the water But they were youknow placed very nice way Uhh in ancient time
They were having lot of knowledge with themof placing the sluice gates in such a way
that minimum silt deposition will be occurring
And this evidence and also there are severalother evidences clearly indicate that the
engineers in ancient Indian had a higher levelof technical skills So let us look at the
sluice system which I will be trying to givea feel that how it looks it is basically single
wall system without any mechanical deviceIt was built of two granite pillar on either
side of sluice mouth and its sizes vary dependingon depth and basically the distance between
two pillars was around 1 to 1.5 meters
So this is a if you look at two stones pillarsare there here and this is having a sluice
gate and sluice with upper moulding this isthe upper mouldings and there is also it is
not visible to you people might be there isa carving of Goddess Lakshmi flanked by elephants
here And these are the you call remnants ofthat and if you look at besides this there
is also some carvings will be here in thesluice whoever will be donors their names
I will be giving some evidence which was basicallymentioned in the work of Kathleen D Morrison
University of Chicago
If you look at this is the remnants of a sluicesystem and this is the place where you can
see white painted portraits of two donorsright one is here and other is here This is
the 15 century Mallappanagudi reservoir inwhich the masonry embankments with the stairs
can be seen These are the stairs you knowthese are also stairs which are partially
buried sluice and this sluice is being buriedin that That means this clearly indicates
that people were donating money for buildingof sluice gates and then embankments and also
the irrigation systems This is the mouth ofthe sluice where the water will be you know
getting into and this is the shutter plank
This plank is the shutter plank and thereis a valve rod which will be lifting up and
down so that you can allow the water to passthrough that And in modern times also similar
sluice you know gate systems are being usedBut not made of granites or not made of stones
rather made of kind of metals If you lookat there are several embankments in ancient
India particularly for the rivers What doyou mean by embankments
Embankment is basically an artificial widewall of stones bricks or earthen mounds which
are built to keep the rivers canals tanksfrom overflowing the the banks right It impound
water and enhances storage capacity of thetank or the river See earlier days Uhh you
know embankments were made in a better waykind of things and these construction of embankment
which is in Sanskrit known as Krtitimani Rodhasigoes back to the Vedic era in Rig Veda there
is a description about it
And aslo in Tamil it is known as Kulai andArukkulai denote the tank bund and the river
embankment And Junagradh inscription relatedto the famous Sudershan Lake by the Rudraman
1 indicates that it is embankment of 100 feetthick were made of stones without any gaps
right I had mentioned that you know how theywere dressing the stones in such a nice way
without modern equipments such that therewon’t be any gap in between Otherwise the
water leakage will be there
And Chola Karikal built embankments of 100miles from the mouth of the river Kaveri in
around 100 AD The excavation in 1915 in TamilNadu indicates that canal embankments were
constructed with hard line gravels mixed withstones and these were rammed enough to withstand
the rush of water Last irrigation reservoirColagangam by Chola Rajendra 1 has embankments
of 12.8 km several sluices and gates and channels
And if you look at the Kathojodi embankmentby Markata Kesari around 1002 AD was built
to save the Cuttack city of Odisha from theerosion due to flood which still remain intact
Unfortunately few years back this on the topof it people have made you know another embankment
kind of things because of the sand depositions
And I will just show you pictures here theseare all made of stones right and which were
there now of course this is the river Kathojodiand this is now the city is at a higher height
because of this embankment New embankmenthas come up this is known as the ring road
If you look at there is also I remember thatwhen they make some embankments what they
do they keep this embankment on the riveron one side and other side they will be you
know having a provision of inundating thefields such that during the floods the water
will be allowed to pass through the otherareas where the cultivation will be going
on
So the silts and other water also will begoing and being to the fields intentionally
And that helps in Uhh what you call havinga good crop due to the enrichment of soil
and also the water So and also they were buildingsome of the temporary wells on the other side
of the river where they will be allowed thewater to inundate So these kinds of ways and
means where there and now we will be talkingabout how did our ancestors manage water you
know harvestings and also water conservationsat that time what they were doing the communities
were providing volunteer labour and materialcultivation for building these facilities
for common good
That was the mind-set unlike in modern dayswhere we always think that government will
do That doesn’t mean that king or localadministrators were not doing anything at
that time They were also helping for the youknow local people for making of initial water
bodies They were paying some money also orthe resources they were mobilising their resources
to build also But the maitenece you know alwayswill be the community members and they conserved
and protected the water from pollution ensuredit is equitable and fair distribution
That was there the job was done by local governanceand also the people were you know coming and
participating in the process they were owningthose water bodies but today it is not And
glorious tradition of water harvesting bythe villagers were talked about in several
places in the scriptures and also in historybooks Communities with strong support and
encouragement from the state was the you knowneed of the hour today and it was there earlier
also And ingenuity and wisdom of our forefatherswho made the harvesting of water its management
and integrated part of native culture andcommunity life
So we need to revive this you know communitylife and (cu) native culture of harvesting
and considering water as divine not misusingit abusing it or polluting it you know for
the sake of industrialisation for the sakeof you know harbouring more money or hoarding
the resources And knowledge transfer fromone generation to another was the very important
which was being uhh stopped today and as wedon’t have faith in traditional knowledge
And non-commercialisation way of solving theproblem of water scarcity like because today
commerce is entering into everywhere So whatwe need to do ‘bahujana Hitaya bahujana
Sukhaya’ should be the ethos with whichwe should go ahead
And lesson from ancient wisdom we can summarisethat we should solve the water problem in
an integrated manner Not that only the waterbut it has to be looked through the eyes of
environment and other creatures other treesand other things Adopt proper lifestyle respecting
the Mother Nature in each entities of theMother Nature Uhh you know are divine and
we should protect it and we should look afterthem Meaning of sustainability in modern times
should be re-evaluated in light of ancientpublic works and management practices
Today we were talking about sustainabilitybut it is not a part of design and our way
of life Technological developments based onthe sound engineering principles integrated
with local culture and traditional knowledgesystem that can be extended useful lives Because
that we need to look at it It is not thatwe will use the old technology of ancient
time but we need to improvise it We cannotreally do that at this moment
But local culture and tradition must be integratedto that Active participation of community
in saving water problems must be encouragedand which should come from our heart and in
water stressed areas development of an effectivewater resource management program is essential
and the need of the hour Water technologiesby the people for the people of the people
It should not be with the companies or multinationalcompanies ok or any companies even Indian
companies It should be with the people
And local materials and local sustainabletechnologies should be used for water harvesting
and water irrigation systems And now withthese is it possible to use ancient knowledge
for the water harvesting and reviving thedead river today If you look at this is the
things I will just tell you it is a very verydry area and there are no rivers kind of things
It was in 1985 and a group Tarun Bharat Sanghled by Sri Rajendra Singh who had done a wonderful
work on this water conservation He has developedwith local knowledge and he could have you
know a river system revived the river whichwas dry dried out in 1985 where in 2000 That
means within 15 years if you look at lot ofgreenery this is the same mountain what it
was earlier
This is the mountain right or hill you cansay but now it is very greenery Now that means
if we use traditional technology and the localparticipation of the people for conserving
we can really do wonders
And this is another things what I would liketo show you also this is the area what is
very dry and they made these cheek dams hereThis is the dam right and water is falling
by the local people even water is (()) (19:52)and they could make a lot of greenery things
in that area And there is a if you look atits 1885 sorry it is 1985 this kind of things
these people had made these dams and slopesand this water will fall and they could made
you know lot of cultivation in and aroundthese water bodies have come up
And similarly lot of you know good flowersgreenery you can see in 2012 So that means
with the use of these traditional technologiespeople can revive and people of the local
people are having developed rather in thelocal people have now developed a faith in
that as some of the people could demonstratethat it is possible And the knowledge you
know with the people not with the companies
That is important Let us look at how we canget suitable integrated water management method
from this And if you look at we should havebasically two ways of looking at improving
the quality of life Ultimately all engineeringall the activities what we do is to improve
the quality of life Quality of life can beimproved basically on-farm employment which
is very essential for us so also the off-farmemployment If you look at I have already talked
about you know off-farm employment like yourwhat you call making houses and then cottage
industries and also the textiles lot of thingscan be made locally
And on farm the farming is very importantand when you talk about that we need water
we need soil and there is Lift Irrigationand water harvesting systems and there will
be water and soil conservation also importantAnd Uhh that what you call afforestation activates
has to be also stopped and joined forest managementwhich will be basically by the local people
community support services has to be developed
And these all these can be developed withthe extension of training and financial support
and this will be coming from the village institutionand communicate participations It can be if
you look Uhh at this will be the main thingand of course for this during the training
we need to have infrastructure energy serviceswhich may be utilised for the off farm system
kind of things And which will be again wecan develop the human resources and we can
aslo look at the natural resources it willbe integrated manner It is not that only the
water it is related to the you call the uhh‘roti kapda and makaan’ which is the basic
needs That is your house food and the clotheswhich are the basic needs had to be made in
an integrated manner without really spoilingthe nature rather leaving with the nature
So that is the thing what we need to learnfrom this So what can we do for the water
crisis We need to have efficient water managementstrategies and techniques that is conservation
reuse and recycle and we will have to developawareness among people regarding water management
how to use the water sparingly and initiatecommunity concept of living a purposeful life
which is very important and we need to goback to the indian village culture of living
harmoniously with Mother Nature Today thepeople are you know trying to convert the
villages into towns I always feel that weneed to convert the towns into village that
means which will be integrated with the MotherNature
And there will be some cultivation lands insidethe town itself so that they will be self-sufficient
Nature friendly ancient Indian water technologiesaccess to the good sanitation and drinking
water must be nurtured and rain water harvestingis very important that we need to look at
because that is the what you call we needto collect Unfortunately because of industrialisation
we are getting acid rain Now how we will takecare Basically we will have to stop this industrialisation
however we can go for the cottage industriesand we will have to capture and store rainfall
and use it efficiently
Harvest each and every drop of rain and catchit where it falls Like you know ‘pani ki
barbadi roko is ke liye sabhi ko toko bachatkaroge bood boond ki apne man mein thano.’
So with this quotation from poet I would liketo stop over here And water is precious we
need to conserve it We will have to use ourancient technologies and also the way of life
live with the nature not against the natureAnd all our lives should revolve around such
that we will be a part and parcel of the MotherNature and lead a very purposeful and peaceful
life Thank you very much
