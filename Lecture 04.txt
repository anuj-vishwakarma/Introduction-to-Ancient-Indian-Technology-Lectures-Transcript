Let us start this lecture with a thought processthat is creativity is the alchemy of human
life As I told the creativity is a part andparcel of human life provided we are being
educated in real properly And also that dependson the social and political environment where
we are living So and that is the panacea ratherI can say of all the problems what we are
facing today So let us (rec) recall that whatwe learnt in the last lecture
We basically looked at the why our ancientscience and technology relevant today That
question we are trying to answer In the processwe looked at what are the problems we are
facing in modern time due to the blatant misuseabuse of modern science and technology And
we looked at also the how we are leading lifehow it is connected with that But now we know
the problems you know causes of the problemsbut what are the solution We need to look
at it
So for that we will have look at a a verygreat person His name is Kautilya whose name
isÖalso known as Vishnugupta who was instrumentalin uhh installing the Chandragupta as a king
Mauryan empire So he he has also written avery beautiful book known as Arthashastra
which is the most (())(01:39) book on thestatecraftship and then lot of science and
technology in that and lot of things are there
So I would urge upon you people to look atthat book It is a one of the rarest book and
we lost a lot of book due to the invasionby the outside people and they destroyed lot
of thing But fortunately we are having thatbook and we could see that that what science
technology philosophy and other things weare having at that time that book
What he says He says that Naven anvam shodhyetWhat is the meaning of that That means relook
at the past heritage with modern outlook Heis not saying that you just copy the old thing
and then you know new way No you should shouldnot do the old wine in a new bottle You will
have to research find it out look at the essenceand do whatever required at this moment And
this is the very important thing
What we are doing today in the name of modernitywe are just copying the western people and
pasting here copy-paste you know We do notunderstand that those things what they are
doing that may be good for them but not forgood for us That does not mean we will not
learn from them We should learn from thembut with understanding with its implication
with by integrating with our culture and heritagevalues that we have inherited from time immemorial
So therefore we need to look at it and thatis the message what he has given
So what are the solution then Solutions areuhh whatever come to my mind I will tell but
I just want to hear from you that what arethe solution coming to your mind He has given
us pointers or the direction Kautilya he hassaid ìLook at the heritage Do research on
that find it out what is the essenceî ThatmeansÖwhat is the meaning
Meaning is that we need to look at our rootyes or no Can anybody uhh can any of you tell
me any other points Because root is very importantAnd once you look at root then we need to
look at uhh this back to our cultural heritageright which thrives for thousands of years
Even today you will find signature of ourculture which was there even Harappa and before
that Can anybody tell me any signature youare aware
Even the peacher the way we make it was therein Harappan time technology-wise Peacher you
know like for getting you knowÖcollectingthe water right out of mud That still it is
going on There are several things like forexample in your auspicious occasion you put
a peacher full of water Why And that traditionis there from Vedic era still we are following
it
But we should know why we are following itright So there are several signatures but
those signatures although what you call markersare going out day-by-day from us due to the
blatant what you call acceptance of modernprinciples from western people without understanding
So it is just you knowÖthat is why we needto beÖI call it as cultural invasion for
us We do not understand there is invasion
So therefore we need to be careful and dothat and try to investigate the ancient scientific
heritage of our civilization As I am emphasizingtime and again this civilization is is still
alive although it is about to die But we canmake it survive with our own effort by understanding
its efficacy So therefore we need to investigatedo research; do not be emotional that we are
part No we will have to find out what is thetruth
As I told we are truth searcher So thereforewe should do that and redefine the philosophy
of science and technology If you look at thewestern way of doing the thing that they will
have to win over them Those science and technologyas basically reductionist reductionist they
will find out small They look at very myopiceyes they do not do not look at the bigger
pictures
They will say ìLook if I take a mountainwhat will happen If I destroy this thingÖî
So for example I will tell you give one exampleWe are having Eastern Ghat Western Ghat which
is protecting us from the seaís onslaughtbecause nature will work lot of wind will
come in the rainy seasons and summer rightAnd that will be taken thwarted by the West
That will also water will come over thereand then cloud will come make the rain and
then we will get water and this thing Butif we destroy what will happen What will happen
to the ecology It will get spoiled and weare doing that right
And therefore and we should say these areall divine And our scripture says ìThose
are allÖmountains uhh jungles and then (fore)like other things all the limbs of the Mother
Nature are divineî Therefore we should notdestroy it We shouldÖso therefore we should
be a part of it And we look at whole pictureholistic approach
So therefore the philosophy has to be definedand we should say that we are not living alone
we should live with others Man is not onlythe animal should be here in this earth all
are connected interconnected So interconnectivityhas to be accepted in total while designing
developing technologies and also unravelingthe (scien) science So that philosophy has
to be changed and which is not with the modernphilosophy of science and technology
Redefine our individual life We are not hereto blender we are not here to only take food
and sleep and then die We are here to helpand realize our potential So therefore reshape
the collective (law) life of our society livetogether Togetherness joining Vasudhaiva kutumbakam
that means all are family It is not only thehuman being but the animal insect even birds
even this any other living non-living allare part of Brahman what you call our scripture
So that is has to be looked at
So what I was telling therefore we need tolook at our root Root is very important because
without root we cannot really grow And wewant to grow as a human being And so therefore
to have a faith in our culture and heritageIt is not a blind faith that I am talking
about It is not that something is writtenin a Bible or Veda that I will have follow
No I will have to question the wisdom whateverit is there even in our scriptures even in
our our life because our scripture says ìJugtiJugtam bacho grayam bala tapi sukha tapi jugtihinam
bachang tejyam buddhatapi sukha tapiî Themeaning is that even if a person or small
baby even a parrot is telling some logicalthing please follow that; if a person of wisdom
a old man or a knowledgeable person is sayingsomething wrong which is illogical please
do not accept it
That is the ethos what our scriptures hastalked about it and we need to follow But
once that does not mean that I do not knowI will say it is no I need to investigate
I need to find out we need to look at it checkit and then say and then have a faith in that
So that is the cultural heritage we are havingto explore the new ways and means to overcome
the excessive exploitation of nature armedwith power of science and technology
So that means we need to (ove) overcome thisproblem to live with the nature use the minimum
The Western world consume more; it is otherway around consume less distort less Suppose
for example I can manage with two or threeshort pants I can have I can take less amount
of food I do not need it right I do not needyou know like nowadays people are having ñ
husband-wife two person three cars We do notneed it
So therefore this is and when you are do atraveling you can take people with you so
that it will be good Even if you are goingcar alone why you will go alone You take 3-4
people so that people will be benefited andthe pollution can be reduced So this is the
way you need to redefine your life an individuallife and this thing and also find out how
we will live with Mother Nature
So to learn about the philosophy of life laidby our ancestors that may lead us to the sea
of happiness and prosperity Because the balanceis a very important key for the human life
which was being propagated and professed byyour ancestors so therefore we need to look
at it And to explore and experience our potentiality
Our scripture says ìWe have infinite potentialîIf we are having infinite potential and human
being can experience that And we need to dothat then only we can do a better science
and technology so that you will get intuitivepower And intuitive power is very important
for doing better science and technology
To express ourselves for serving others selflessly:Unless you serve other unless your heart will
uhh bleat for the people around you then youwill not get the ideas of you know or intuitive
knowledge you will not get So therefore thatis has to be done to revive our ancient science
and technology and its ethos So thereforeyou need to do that So that is the way we
need to uhh go about it
And I will just tell you the glimpses of ancientIndian science and technology because it is
a very vast and also we do not have a lotof you know scriptures at this moment and
because most of are being destroyed And alsowith the modernity lot of scriptures which
were lying maybe during my grandfather timesand that were not taken care
I will I will tell from my experience My fatherleft my village grandfatherís village And
then he was having lot of scriptures lyingI I remember uhh you know that I had gone
home and there in the pooja house there isa lot of you know scriptures in the palm leaves
and then my grandfather died And then everythinglost I do not know what the those scriptures
will be containing
But today when I am thinking of looking atthose are not there So therefore it is not
true with my family alone it is with the mostof the things and we lost it And so therefore
we will not get all the things but I willtell you the very roughly what it is thinks
We can go by chronological order And if youlook at 25000 BC before we call it basically
Early Stone Age or people call it Paleolithicperiod early Paleolithic periods where people
are using copper and chopping tools hand-axekind of things right And uhh and this what
people are telling Whatever I am saying itis because uhh whatever the historians they
have accepted But if you look at our otherscriptures they do not agree with that
But I am saying whatever people have acceptedright There might be much more than that and
I do not want to invite you know controversy;otherwise I could have talked about it But
let us say in that region Punjab region PeninsularIndia and extreme south they were having the
what you call people were having uhh you knowhabitats during in these areas
And 25000 to 5000 BC we are having basicallyMiddle Stone Age what we call and Middle Paleolithic
period And predominance of flake tools likeyou know scrappers like borers points; they
were using various metal even some stonesbeing used basically I think metal came metal
came later on according to the modern historians
And 5000 to 3000 BC we call it Late StoneAge Predominance of microliths you know is
a very tiny tools which will beÖpeople willbe using Flakes and blades and lunates lunates
means you know crescent shape of lunar thatkind of tool they were using And scrappers
you know the we scrap the floor that way Andchisels trapezoidal shape triangular shapes
you know like drills and borers they startedusing the metals And these are the same region
And 3000 to 1500 BC Harappa Culture whichwas accepted worldwide But if you look at
recently uhh as I told in the last lectureIIT Kharagpur people have done research and
published in Nature journal they are claimingthat it is 8000 years back That means basically
(fo) 6000 BC right And we are cultured andalways we feel that it is not 6000 rather
10000 or more than that That is the our wayof thinking
But we need to do research to prove it Itis not that we will say it is we need to do
research I hope and wish with this lectureyou people will be motivated to carry out
research and give some of your time to unraveland prove to the world that we are having
a very old civilization and great culture
So copper-bronze technology we are havingvery good And Lost-wax casting process those
people will be knowing and I will be talkingabout it that we use this ideal right making
in modern time We use this technique for makingthe turbine blades compressors and other things;
very intricate shapes we can fabricate
And wheels made decorated and glazed potterypottery were very good at that time Agriculture
technology I will be discussing about thatwhat we are doing Domestication of animal
drainage and public bath we will be discussing(showing) I will be showing some picture later
on We are using bricks since 3000 BC And nowit is being you know established that it is
not 3000 BC 6000 BC
Mortar constructions you know buildings likewe do Town planning I will be discussing about
later on Spinning weaving; basically thisis about textiles right And navigations and
dockyards we are having proof to show thatwe are having you know uhh sheep building
technologies and dockyard to keep the sheepsthere And it is the Sind Punjab Rajputana
Haryana and Saurashtra regions it is a verylarger regions
And of course I always feel the southern sidepart; these are the northern part and then
northern western side kind of thing But Ialways believe the southern part also willing
be having a great thing because the sea wasthere So therefore I am having belief but
this that has to be proved
So if you look at 1500 to 1000 BC the Vedicera what people already accepted but my belief
is that it is much before that that But Ido not have a proof If you people will get
the proof it will be nice And concept of naturallaws people talk about laws you know physical
laws they were having that And monistic ideaconcerning water I will be quoting something
from Upanishad what water is when I will betalking about water harvesting And Nakshatra
system that is what we use for our astrologyyou know it was from Vedic era
And there is a (Vedic) Vedanga Jyotisa alsocalendar system Calendar of course we are
using the other calendar we are having ourown calendars which is very old and very sophisticated
You can predict a lot of thing out of calendarunlike your what you call this modern calendar
What you call that
Student: Gregorian
Professor: Gregorian calendar right That isnot that good according to me but of course
we are using it So knowledge of diseases andcure like healthwise so they are identifying
Agriculture use of plough fermentation methodsyou know this also was there And number names
on decimal scale up to 10 power to12 I cannotthink what will be the size of number they
were thinking you know Today it is very difficultto think
So that is again there are talking about PunjabKashmir regions Western UP Gangetic Plains;
they were not concerned about the southernpart I always believe that will be there And
uhh because for this people have excavatedand they got the evidence right And their
excavation need to be done in the southernside but where to do that is another question
You know like where I will go I cannot excavateall the places So that is the thing
And this something 1000 to 700 BC YajurvedaAtharvaveda you know Brahmanas and Aranyakas
all those things being you know uhh writtenpeople are talking about There is a several
things I will not go through it I will onlytell that that these are the things which
people are having Like mathematical seriesright And they were talking about cosmic cycles
And you know like we areÖhave used some Tellerseries
There are several binomial series we willdo lot of things are there in our you know
from the time And more physiological anatomicaland about the health And doctrine of Pancha-bhutas
we talk about sometimes we do uhh know maybeyou people may not be aware at least I was
aware about Pancha-bhutas Painted-grey waresand then the people started using iron during
this Vedic era right And their uses and evensoil fertility how to enhance the fertility
of the land For agriculture they have starteddoing like your compost what we use you know
And 600 to 500 BC this is basically usingof iron and steel and then and then they are
claiming the modern historians they are sayingeastern part ofÖeastern part and central
and other parts of India this already spreadthis civilization what they are claiming But
I do not believe I believe that is the totalplace the civilization was there Maybe small
pockets where the what you call jungles andother thing there but it is the whole country
according to me
But do not go by me go by the historians becausethose are provable okay Toh 500 to uhh something
around AD uhh till this thing Vedanga Jyotisaand Sulba-sutra and Vaisesika if you look
at is very great things because they willbe talking about structure of the atom You
must not have studied this in atomic theorybecause we do not teach that thing; we teach
the outside country what they are talkingWe are having a very beautiful system atomism
and time and motion and the sound whateverthe physics you look up; of course they look
at in a very different way
Their main objective is spirituality but inthat they look at So and beside this if you
look at you know this Pythagoras theorem andother thing these are there during this Sulba-sutra
is much before the Pythagoras And binomialseries and then several others like geometry
rational numbers and lot of things you knowwere there but we need to look at And again
it has spread to the other part eastern andcentral part of the India
So this is from 0 like your this thing tothe 500 AD And there is a several treatise
have come up during that time One is Charakaand Sushruta Samhita you might be aware because
today Ayurveda being again coming back soalso yoga So therefore some of you might be
aware And Nyayabhasya Nyayabhasya is anotherthings And as I told Arthashastra of Kautilya
by the Vishnugupta And the Jain and Buddhascriptures there is lot of things and lot
of you know science and you can see in thosescriptures also
So if you look at there is a lot of thingsare there I will not go through all of them
Only I will tell you few of them like forexample glass making started doing that And
uhh for example propagation of sounds andthe classification of animal and plants they
have done in a very systematic way I am likewe need to look at it We are not beingÖwe
are not teaching those thing in the schooland college it should be taught
And like pie sine values extraction so ifyou look at square and cube roots was a difficult
one you know we always use quadratic equationright But cube roots and then again first
order equations and then other things arebeing talked about in this here And uhh there
is a engineering-wise lot of things like forgingsyou know like uhh what you call lithographies
and laparotomy and then you know rhinoplastynowadays it is also being used So something
19 decimal points you know where they startedand wrought iron made of cast in two layers
particularly in (Indo) Indo-Gangetic Plains
And if you look at uhh in 600 AD onwards thereis a uhh several thing like Panchasiddhantikas
like Saura Paulisa Romakar Brahma and PaitamahaThese are the things The lot of concept they
put together During that a concept Mahajugawhat they calling uhh that is a very big years
they are saying various jugas like TetrajugaDwaparajuga all those things And uhh the Brihat
Samhita of Varahamihira is being written atthat time and where the chemical processes
plant and animal classifications
And uhh there was a another book which isvery good and then it is still there Of course
lot ofÖas I told lot of scriptures lot oftextbooks were being burnt out because of
you might be aware this Nalanda and otherthings got destroyed And we are the first
people you know we are having several universityin ancient times so those university were
being destroyed So we lost a lot of thing
And classification synonyms of plants animalsand minerals and metals they have done in
Amarakosa And uhh these are of course theencyclopedia today you are seeing thinking
but at that time it was there like Surya Siddhantaprovide the best and most accurate tithis
Like this (Suddya) Surya Siddhanta is a bookyou know which will provide about the tithis
And 700 to 800 this is uhh Brahmashphutasiddhantalike if you look at it is having a lot of
treatise about mathematics astronomy and otherthings where the uhh equation of second or
arithmetic progression for any terms you knowlike lot of complex mathematics are beingÖarea
of cyclic (quadri) quadrilaterals volume rulesdiagnostic methods are being talked about
If you look at that book was translated intothe like Sindhind that book is translated
Brahmashphutasiddhanta which was by the Brahmaguptait is being translated to Arabic you know
And then there is another book Khandakhadyakaby uhh by the again Brahmagupta is (())(27:05)
to Arkand his name is in Arabic
And uhh like (Madhav) Madhavanidhana whichis also translated into Badon and then Asthangahridaya
is a Ayurvedic text by Vagbhata is also translatedinto Arabic like Astankar So there areÖthese
are the things we know it is being translatedThere might be several things which might
be translated and gone to the western countrieswe do not know right Or nor we are doing research
on that at this moment
So therefore there are lot of things are thereAnd I would like to stop over here and we
look at this chronological in the next lectureWe canÖnow at least you can having the idea
about Whatever the little text we are havingtoday it is showing a lot Now if we imagine
that all that scriptures we could have kepteven some of the scriptures are people are
trying and to uhh get them back And lot ofpeople are having they do not want to give
because of possessiveness
And there was a what you call attempt by Ithink maybe 20 years back by the government
of India but it was not very successful Butstill they are claiming they are having something
around 10000 scriptures they are having Butwhere (tho) are those things And I will be
also telling you little later on that whereyou can get some of the informations I will
be telling in the uhhÖafter few lectureswhere you can go and do research get those
information Thank you very much listeningand I will continue in the next lecture
