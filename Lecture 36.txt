We can start this lecture with a thought process`Power doesn’t corrupt a person it reveals
the corrupted mind of a person’ In the lastlecture we discussed about how the iron was
being used in ancient India and we had takenseveral examples and also evidences for that
And today we will be discussing about IronSmelting Process that was used in Ancient
India Traditional The traditional Iron SmeltingProcess contains six steps
First is of course one has to collect theraw material and one has to prepare it properly
Construction of furnace and tuyere pipe isalso very important And one has to make and
fix air bellows properly Uhh and ignitionand furnace operation removal of slag and
handling of hot sponge iron 2nd is refiningof iron bloom is also another way you know
Uhh process one has to use it
And collection and preparation of raw materialsUhh is very important and let us see how ancient
people were doing it And we know that thereis a several ores like Haematites and Limonites
ores were being used and also some of theMagnetites Uhh sand were used for the production
of the iron And evidence is there that miningin ancient India was carried out even at the
depth of 20 metres from the ground level Andgenerally the Uhh people wherever they will
get iron ore they will Uhh Uhh try to smeltit there itself and or they can choose another
place particularly forest area where the woodcharcoal Uhh you know will be available or
they can make the charcoal from the Uhh drywood in the forest
And it is not only the man Uhh who will beUhh you know involved in the smelting process
women also were involved earlier time duringthe smelting process And particularly for
transporting the ore ore and dig it out afterperforming puja Puja or the worship was very
important and generally it has been carriedout by women for the successful smelting of
iron
So Uhh if you look at the Uhh iron ore andhas to be collected and one has to identify
that and most of the furnaces use Haematitesand Limonite containing around 30 to 40% ore
iron ore which are mined Uhh around from 2to 50 metres from the ground level And once
they get this iron ores from the mines theywill be trying to Uhh dry it using the sun
rays and also Uhh they were breaking intothe pieces of size something 5 to 6 mm
Uhh Sometimes if moisture is more in the ironores what they will be they will be heating
it at a low temperature so that excess moisturewill be Uhh removed and in some regions like
Assam or South India Magnetite is being handleddifferently Because Magnetite is a different
kind of ore iron ore has to be handle besidethis Uhh you know they were also producing
metal powders There is a shloka which themeaning is that throw the flowing iron mixed
in water in a broken pot and melt it and thenafter washing the iron ore they will put into
the iron mortar and also pound it with thepestle so that there will be powder
The preparation process of Charcoal and whatevidence suggests that various local woods
namely Irool Teak Sal Babool or Bamboo etc.
Uhh are used for producing dense and heavycharcoal Because you need to have Uhh the
charcoal which will be dense and heavy forthis kind of work and they were aware that
which Uhh wood will be giving and they werealways relying on the local material instead
of getting from outside in the way do in thepresent time
The dried branches of trees were cut and burntthem in an open heap or inside a pit so that
you know pyrolysis will be occurring and thegases will go out and the carbon will be remaining
And once the wood is charred fire was extinguishedby covering the burning wood with green leaves
and twigs and sprinkling water on it And beehivetype firing chambers were also used for preparation
of charcoal This is a very good design ifyou look at this is Uhh being a you know mimic
from the nature like Uhh if you look at thehoney bee they are having beehive kind of
things After complete extinguishment of firefollowed by adequate cooling charcoals were
collected and also the proper size of thecharcoal is to be collected
And they used also and there is no evidenceof lime or lime stone being used as flux Uhh
but however the Silica SiO2 and CaO presentin the ore and char charcoal ash can act as
a flux for making iron slag to flow The extractionfrom material used by the Ayurvedic method
that is `Satvapatan’ indicates use of Boraxas a flux We will be discussing about that
how they were using Uhh you know the Boraxand in the particularly Ayurvedic method of
making iron In latter time lime was used asa flux in iron smelting in Ujjain M.P and
Bairut in Rajasthan right So these are thekinds of fluxes flux material what they were
using to remove the slag during the smeltingprocess
And there are various kinds of furnaces arebeing used in ancient time Uhh and these furnace
types will be varying from region to regionHowever I will be discussing few of them because
of paucity of time And Uhh so several smalland large furnaces used till 18th century
for making iron Of course after that Uhh Britishershaving their own factory in other places and
they Uhh discouraged the people to have localirons that is why those Uhh you know pro methodology
were lost and of course in modern India weare not bothered about the indigenous manufacturing
of the iron by the local people
And these furnace were called Bhatti in someplaces Kothi Kosthi were made from locally
available clay The if you look at these arevery simple and lot of innovations Uhh you
know Uhh being used by the various peopleto make them different and also to use the
local material The internal contours of somefurnaces were lined with natural china clay
or refractory material The like what is evenin today in blast furnaces that you know the
furnace lining are being used Uhh you knowparticular refractory materials are being
used as furnace liners The furnace were madeof either below the ground level or on the
sloping of a hillock or above the ground levelthere are various kinds you one can see
And Uhh most of furnaces were having two holesone for charging and other for Uhh the passage
of molten slag And generally tuyere and thepipe pipes were used for supplying air And
Classification of Ancient Indian Furnace ifyou look at furnace in South India were having
bowl shaped hearth and conical shaft cylindricalfurnace of Madhya Pradesh where bloom were
removed from the top of the furnace Kothitype furnace of Bhopal or Ujjain with a square
or rectangular cross section for a large productionthat means getting something 250 kg per day
which is a quite a huge amount if you compareto other furnaces at that time
And let us look at Uhh furnace which is knownas Naikund Furnace and which is quite old
it goes back to 700 BC in Nalanda Uhh thisNaikund and even Uhh Khairadih and Ujjain
and other places you can find And this isa very simple Uhh furnace which is being used
like they use the clay bricks and there isa tuyere what is basically supplying the air
to be sucked in and then this charcoals whichare there so also iron and the blooms these
are the iron blooms and the slag at the willbe moving out of this in this passage And
a typical one which will Uhh you might haveseen in somewhere even Uhh poor people use
it now-a-days but of course Uhh it is Uhhnot been practiced very much And it is Uhh
made from prefabricated clay bricks whereasthe furnace in western country were made by
digging holes in the earth right in ancienttime
So there is another Dhatwa Furnace if youlook at here the smelting charges are there
again in the ground also it has been madeAnd the these are the burning coals and you
are having a bellows here that will be givingthe air will be coming through that and the
you know bellows one can press it that airwill be sucking in and going these are air
passages This is another kind of furnace whichwas there in ancient India
And let us look at a furnace which was usedearlier days by Tribal of Bishnupur And this
is the cross section if look at this is havinga conical shape and this is the tuyere and
the diameter here is around 50 500 mm andon the top it is 150 mm diameter And it is
having Uhh the what you call support for withthe help of a bamboo and rope will be there
And if you take a of course Uhh you know thisheight is 800 mm Uhh if you take this cross
section you will get this one that is theshape
In India furnaces in iron melting and othersseem to be reused after refining rela relining
it and repairing with refractory clay unlikethe cluster of furnace excavated in western
countries which were not having liners andthey were using once and then after that they
will not use it That is the difference betweenthe technology in ancient India what were
it was there
Let us look at how Uhh you know they weredoing this kind of a Uhh putting this air
there is a as I told there is a bamboo willbe there and then Uhh if I take this cross
section here you know this is the slag pitswhich is being not shown in this figure And
these are of course the Uhh blooms iron bloomsthis is the tuyere pipe which will be connected
to the bamboo air pipes and these are bellowsBellows will be made of something hide Uhh
or else what you call skin and on which topof which you know people will be jumping on
it so that it will take air and this is thediaphragm will be moving up and down and then
sucking air then going out I will be showinga figure about that
So if you look at what I was telling thisis one and which is with the help of a stick
you know he will be balance and you need tohave balance that This is the yellow bellows
right on which will be like you know jumpingon it rhythmically right and this is the tuyere
they use this this as look at clay tuyerewhich are being used they are pipes through
which air will be passing through it thisis for air pipes right And Air bellows are
made in the form of wooden trough with a cavityaround 300 mm dia and 15 mm height And near
bottom of this 35 mm was Uhh made in the sidewall to fix bamboo pipes are having 12-15
mm diameter and 500-600 mm length
Other end of this bamboo pipe was insertedin the large end of the clay tuyeres like
from here they will be things and it is carriedto the furnace because the bamboo will get
burnt you know therefore you will have touse a clay pipe That means they are using
combination of the bamboo and the pipe Thetop of the wood trough was covered with moist
piece of leather and here the leather willbe there this is the place and leather having
a flap with a hole in the center It will bemoving up and down so that through which air
will be coming going in and then passing throughthat
And there will be also what you call a valvewhich will be closing it you know so that
air will get into this leather and then afterthat it will be go up and then this air will
be when you push it air will be getting intothis pipe This is a indigenous pump you know
pump system and which were operated by theUhh what you call Uhh muscle power And one
has to do with rhythmically that means ifyou do this thing you will have to also develop
your mind not only physical labour is requiredalso the mind coordination is important for
operating this kind of bellows
So let us look at another smelting furnaceat Ghatgaon and which is shown this is like
acting like a what you call natural draftthis is the tuyere through which air is passing
through it of course all the dimensions aregiven here if you take a drawing of this This
kind of furnace was constructed partiallybelow the ground because this portion is a
ground level right unlike the Naikund furnacewhich is which is on the on the top right
above the ground So Uhh as I told this isthe air tuyere or the air pipe you can say
through which air will be passing gettinginto this furnace for the combustion to occur
and then so that reduction of the iron willbe taking place
There is a another furnace which is at Jiragoraand which is having of course a similar support
but here having what you call slag drainsand this is your hearth which is below the
ground level and this is a slag pit if youlook at the this will be a slag pit kind of
thing where slag will come and then you knowbe deposited there and you can remove And
this is your air passage tuyere which willbe having So if you look at there are several
designs one can see across the various partsof the country And they were using their creative
power to develop themselves and of coursethese are the support platform for this structure
to remain
And there is another Twin Shaft Furnace fromMalabar region and this I have shown here
This is the phase one and this is the phasetwo kind of things these are the pipe holes
right through which this is the slag pit rightand this is the earth hearth And if look at
this is there is a platform where you cantake this out and I think this Uhh this twin
hearth furnace was fitted with more than onepair of bellows for supply of air and peep
holes were located suitably for monitoringthe inside temperature of furnace That is
very interesting that means you know you canremove these holes and then see whether doing
well or not accordingly you will have to Uhhyou know supply the more amount of air or
reduce it
As per the Buchanan it could produce 250 kgof iron per day It was in 1807 if look at
something around 110 years back we were havingthis technology unfortunately today it is
not there In India furnaces for iron smeltingothers seems to be reused after lining and
repairing with the refractory clay unlikeclusters of furnaces excavated in western
countries This is the thing which I had repeatedwhich I had told earlier and now being repeated
So that is the Uhh you know beauty of Uhhthe Uhh ancient Indian furnaces which were
used for making iron
Let me talk about another Uhh type of Uhhfurnace which was being mentioned which is
being mentioned in Rasa Ratna Samuccaya andin this furnace one can get around 1500 degree
Celsius But other furnaces people are claimingyou cannot go beyond 1200 degree Celsius right
In this case this is the figure which is shownhere it is similar to that earlier that means
bellows will be there with a tuyere and theseare the Uhh what you call the charge charge
means having you know coal and other thingswill be there and here they will be using
a crucibles right and this will be charcoaland through which air will be coming over
here right and they burnt out and then theyit will burn here and then this thing
And then generally this is being used forextraction iron from Biotite Biotite formula
is given and this is being used for basicallyUhh for Ayurvedic medicines Satvapatana Process
that is the shodhana purifications Bhavanathe Maceration and Triturating and Dhamana
- is heating and smelting And the liquid usedfor Shodhana of minerals like Kanji fermented
liquid basically if you look at it is a Uhhvery Uhh sour butter milk you can think of.
And Triphala quath Harida Bahada and Amlaright is a Ayurvedic materials and Cow’s
urine and Cow’s milk So these are the waysby which they will be purifying the minerals
And this process is accompanied with intermediateBhavana leading to palletization of charge
like 20-30 mm balls they will be making whichis made of Mica around 200 gms Borax 50 gms
Musali powder 50 gms Of course this will beacting as a reductant and this will be mix
with this Uhh iron powders and then will bekept in this crucible and then you will heat
it with the help of bellows and then whichcan go to the very high temperature Uhh 1500
degree Celsius the material And the problemwith this kind of method is that you will
get you will be getting iron in a small quantitynot in a 250 kg per day And Rasa Ratna Samuccaya
describes 51 kinds of metallurgical toolsand 31 kinds of equipments 17 types of crucibles
and 9 types of furnaces and 5 types of coatings
That means if you look at there is a plethoraof knowledge about the smelting process and
the tools which are being mentioned aboutin this text But now one has to look at it
carefully and also look at what can be usedtoday and how this knowledge can be transferred
to the people particularly not about textualknowledge rather practical knowledge That
has not been done and unfortunately I wishthat some of you should take it up not that
you will depend on the government to do thatrather individual has to do it
Now we will be discussing about the differencebetween the blast furnace which is being used
for iron in modern time this is the one ofthe Uhh workhorse for producing Uhh producing
the iron from the iron ore and this is quitehuge If look at this is the furnace which
is coming containing the iron ore and limestone and coke they will be putting it here
and there is a also the temperature is beingmaintained these are the fire clay and bricks
of course lining will be there And this isthe cup and cone for arrangements so that
it will be flow very nicely and the temperatureis being maintained properly that is very
important and 1700 maximum temperature itcan go up to
And you will be using hot air it is you knowis very important where as in our traditional
we used to the cool air I mean normal or ambientair And the slag which will be coming out
slag out of course you will get the molteniron out kind of things But the length if
you look at it is 20 to 35 metres it is quitehuge Of course the diameter Uhh is 6 to 14
metres and it can produce something 100 youknow Uhh tons to may be Uhh 1000 of tons of
Uhh iron this is very huge
Now you want to Uhh you know compare withour earlier one with the blast furnace this
is very small something height will be 700mm like this is in meter you know and this
will be diameter will be 300 or may be 400mm outer diameter But this technique of blast
furnace is quite you know involved and complexin nature the chemistry But here and this
even one has to go for 1700 degree Celsiuswhere as the Uhh ancient Uhh process is the
direct reduction reaction occurring at 1200degree Celsius
Fe2O3 will be reacting with Carbon monoxidewill be getting into iron and carbon dioxide
And if you compare both the thing this oneancient furnace and blast furnace blast furnace
is quite complex and nobody can really changeit you know that quickly you know because
it is so huge Whereas anybody can change thissmall furnace and you can innovate a lot of
things and do that And this is a lower temperaturetherefore being used as a result the Uhh you
wi as a result you will can also you no costwill be very lower But the quality of the
iron one has to also look at it
But what people found that this quality iscomparable with the blast furnace and but
the quantity here it will be very less ascompared to the blast furnace where the quantity
will be high because it is very huge And soUhh therefore we need to I mean at least go
back to this process this ancient furnacewhich will be with the people but now the
blast furnace is with the company right thereis a difference And the knowledge Uhh if you
will go for ancient furnace the knowledgewill be with the common people who will be
using it
And if you look at there is a direct reductionmethod which is being used in ancient Indian
furnace that is iron ore you will have todo this beneficiation and then rich iron ore
you will get that is two and then wood burningyou will get the charcoal And this solid state
reduction which is a known as also the Bloomeryfurnace that is being used in ancient India
which will be operated around 1000 degreeCelsius to 1200 degree Celsius unlike in blast
furnace 1700 degree Celsius you need to maintainFor that you will have to use lot of energy
for that and also the extra of course youwill get a fluid slag fluid slag which is
very easy to remove it
And Uhh you will land in getting hot spongeiron and now this of course people have you
know talking about sponge iron which is cheaperthan the iron being made in the blast furnace
And you just hammer it and then you will getthe iron lump which is very easier process
of getting iron in the ancient method whichis best on the direct reduction of the iron
ore
So Operation of the Furnace if you look atIron ore to charcoal ratio people had used
something 1 is to 2 to 1 is to 4 and thisis to be charged in alternative layers That
means you know if there is a iron here ironore and there will be also the charcoal right
layer by layer there will be iron here andthere will be charcoal it has to be placed
generally charcoal is filled on the top ofthe furnace and fire wood is ignited by inserting
a small piece of burning charcoal right Andwhen fire wood is kindled bellows are put
into the tuyere mouth and air is blown ata slower rate The rate of you know air entering
into the furnace will be small
And slowly rate of blowing air is to be increasedtill the flame about 600 mm appeared at the
top of the furnace That means when you areigniting the because you are igniting from
the top so therefore once this flame increasesyou know then Uhh Uhh after that like rate
of operation of bellows are controlled byobserving the colour and height of the flame
And temperature inside will be ranging somethingUhh 1100 to 1250 degree Celsius And one can
also the you know change this Uhh air flowrates depending on what temperature you want
And one heat of furnace requires around 10to 15 kg of ore and 35 to 40 kg of charcoal
And if you look at today we are using thecoal and which is not sustainable but whereas
charcoal is sustainable That is also anotherimportant point one should keep in mind Because
if you grow the trees and then use it Uhhproperly then we can make it sustainable After
4-5 hours Uhh you know reduction of iron therate of blowing is increased to raise the
temperature of iron and slag And then of courseone can keep it and then remove that thing
So this operation goes on far kind of thingbut these are all manual driven furnaces
And if you look at that we have already discussedthis if you look at carbon is reacting with
oxygen going to the carbon monoxide and carbonmonoxide is reacting with the Fe2O3 getting
to the iron and carbon dioxide Now if youtake ratio of this carbon monoxide to carbon
dioxide 80 is to 2 that means you know thisis basically 4 kind of thing carbon monoxide
to carbon dioxide ratio That you will getsomewhere a you know this if you look at this
a partial pressure CO divided by partial pressureof COplusplus pressure of carbon dioxide you
will be getting around something 0.8 kindof things So around Uhh 1200 or 1000 to 11
1200 you will get basically the iron easilyright in that even atmospheric pressure condition
right That is the good thing that this furnacebeing operated atmospheric pressure so which
is you can get if you maintain this temperature1000 to 1200 kind of thing you will get air
on
The above reduction reactions being exothermiccan provide sufficient amount of heat to maintain
furnace temperature and form the fayaliterich liquid that is the slag so that which
can be removed easily And of course peoplehave done Uhh various heat balance of iron
making furnace at Jiragora this addition towork and where people are trying to Uhh follow
the ancient procedure and see that they havedone all these calculations as I told CO/Co2
= 4 And they were getting that heat for Uhhheating the ore to 1000 degree something you
know they have done carried out heat balancesomething 4920 kcal heat for endothermic reduction
5451 kcal and they have done all these calculationthey are finding out the radiation loss is
around 18.5 percent one can reduce it youknow then you can also enhance its efficiency
And the air blown in 6 hours is something203 meter cube air blown rate is 564 litre
per minute kind of things they are givingthat is the kind of air.
The conclusions can be made out of this analysisthat is the and also this discussion the furnace
charge balance was good enough to producelow carbon wrought iron And the fayalite rich
liquid slag requires addition of Silica fluxto produce recorded quantity of slag And sufficient
amount of air produced by two bellows to producea measured temperature of 1459 degree Celsius
which they had conducted experiments theycould measure So one can see that that means
the method being used by Uhh in ancient timecan be replicated even today
And we will be looking at how they handlingthe sponge iron The hot iron bloom from the
furnace was hammered on the stone anvil toremove the liquid slag to a larger extent
before it gets solidified That means onceit is removed you know it quickly has to be
hammered so that slag can be removed And poroussponge iron was repeatedly heated in the forge
hearth to reforge and produce wrought ironThat means this sponge iron will be converted
into the wrought iron by the heating it andalso with applying the force
And secondary treatment of hot sponge ironis basically Uhh being done in the following
way that is The hot sponge iron that is something3 to 9 kg was consolidated into semi-porous
mass and forging squeezing out the moltenslag With further removal of FeO and fayalite
its density gets increased further right Andthis block is repeatedly heated in the forge
hearth as I mentioned in the Uhh just nowSprinkling of Silica powder so that Uhh Ferrous
Oxide gets converted into Uhh you know thisEutectic as a semi liquid slag at 1170 degree
Celsius
Uhh By repeating the forging of iron pieceis converted into solid rod of specific standard
size which can be classified as to its ductilityand strength Of course this process is being
managed by the judgement and also the by theUhh person who is doing it so therefore the
quality is also one concern And that meansone has to very very carefully do that And
this standardized wrought iron is furtherprocessed by blacksmith to produce various
iron products
So Uhh if you look at that Uhh this is basicallyyou know like the process which is being Uhh
this is the process of iron smelting and alsothe secondary treatment of hot sponge iron
Uhh was discussed just now And from this onecan conclude that there is a very Uhh nice
and systematic procedure were available atthe time and which of course we lost but it
can be revived provided we do some littlebit research and then also transfer the this
knowledge to the people who can manage itSo this will be a can be developed as a cottage
industries and where the knowledge will bewith the people And also there they can utilize
the creativity with that So with this I willstop over In the next lecture we will be discussing
about Uhh basically a various metal makingprocesses of iron and how they were making
a product and other things Thank you verymuch
