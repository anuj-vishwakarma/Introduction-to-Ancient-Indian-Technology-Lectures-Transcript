Let us start this lecture with a thought processTowns in modern India should be built with
the aura of ancient Indian village Sustainabilityis today is the budge word but it was prevailed
in ancient Indian Indian village So thereforewe should have that and we will uh let us
recall that what we had learnt in the lastlecture we basically looked at rural housing
And of course before that agriculture andtextile and today we will be talking about
the urban housings and town planning in ancientIndia And let us look at what are the problems
with the modern town planning and buildingsAnd we can look at whether we can get some
solution from this ancient Indian town planningor not
So as we know that it is very difficult nowa days to keep the temperature in the house
at comfortable level So for maintaining theinternal temperature and also humidity we
will have to use mechanical cooling and heatingsystem for which we will have to use lot of
energy in modern buildings Beside this wastewater management is a big hassle in modern
town so also we do not have greenery meanswhere we can store this greens and of course
most of modern and complex life uh we areliving Actually if you look at we are living
a very complex life in modern days as a resultwe have higher level of carbon foot prints
and road safety is a big problem particularlyin India where around 400 or more people are
dying per minute in this country due roadaccidents And criminal activities going on
at an alarming rate in this place and so alsomanagement of crime is a very big challenging
problem in modern days
So what are the crises of sustainability Ifyou look at global warming is a thing what
we feel every now and then And beside thiswe are encountering the environmental pollution
over exploitation and utilization of naturalresources As a result there is a depletion
of natural resources and so also fossil fuel
So therefore it is very important to havea town planning and we will see why we need
to have proper town planning such that wecan lead a very good life Because the town
planning depends on topography ecology ofland and the needs of the society not the
greeds of society or greeds of you know certainuh people you know market forces which we
are now uh what you call encountering andgoverning body and cultural heritage that
is important But today most of the towns arebeing established and uh without much planning
it is just going on particularly in this countryand we are not taking care of neither the
ecology nor the you know our cultural heritageand other things So indigenous town planning
might have started much before in Indus ValleyCivilization what we are calling now a days
Saraswati river civilization which was around2300 1500 BCE covering an area of covering
an area of 1.25 million square kilometer isa very big you know area
And of course after the demise of Indus ValleyCivilization there was a 2nd phase of town
planning in ancient India around 600 BCE whichis quite evident in literary works and that
is merged with the modern town planning becausethere is a going on till today And of course
in modern time we are just taking the ideasfrom the western countries and then implementing
without thinking And the research work revealsthat 2nd phase of town planning was neither
part of earlier phase earlier phase I meanbasically the Indus Valley Civilization nor
the revival of it nor it was imported fromoutside unlike in modern time It is basically
was developed indigenously which was evolvedfor ages together And if you look at for both
1st and 2nd phases of ancient town planningthe archeological evidences are present in
plenty to establish that those are quite goodand also what you call indigenous in nature
And Indus Valley Civilization if you lookat it was basically in these areas these are
the rivers Indus rivers and then Ravi riversand there is a Ghagar river which is a dry
uh almost And these are the spots if you lookat this yellow colour spots like Rakhighari
Kalibnagan Harappa and then your uh the KotDiji and Mohenjodaro Mehergarh and Dholavira
and there are several other places where youcan have this Indus Valley Civilizations you
know this regions if you look at this is theregion what I am saying it goes to some other
portion of Haryana also Present Haryana thereis a place known as Ropar region this region
belongs to that uh what you call Indus ValleyCivilization And now a days we call it Saraswathi
Sindhu Civilization as I mentioned earlierAnd this civilization was you know located
around Indus River as I told and Ghaggar Pakistanand also North Western India
And if you look at this 1.25 million squarekilometer is basically uh north side it is
in Ropar in present day it is called Roparin Haryana and earlier name was Ropar and
which is not shown in this map And South theBhagatrav which is in Gujarat somewhere which
is also not shown here in this figure andAlamgirpur UP which is near Meerut uh this
place and in the Western side this is SutkagenDor uh which will be nearby this place uh
Sutkagen Dor so it was a quite a big areawhere this civilizations were there as per
the excavation by Archeological Survey ofIndia
And Town planning concept if you look at isbasically in various uh if you look at the
excavation of large number of cities namelyMohenjo daro Harappa Lothal Kalibangan etc
uh basically uh belonged to the Indus ValleyCivilization And this if you look at it is
having uniformity in their layout that meansthere was a basically a planned town planning
and uh and this clearly indicates that thesecities were built with proper design and architecture
with the following factors These factors arebasically if you look at the topology and
ecology of area being riverine civilizationOf course most of the earlier civilization
were riverine means by the side of river andunlike in modern times And rectangular area
with proper orientation with proper cardinalpoints that means there will be a point around
which the cities will be growing
And dwelling place of cities according tosocial status of course not all the places
but in some places And grid iron systems oflaying out streets cutting each other at right
angles and today if you see that uh you willnot find that kind of thing And adequate system
of water supply through well and tanks etcbecause water is very important for life so
therefore always a provision uh were beingmade for the water and improvised system of
fortification for defense and prevention offloods And high level of sanitation and underground
drainage system you could uh you know findin the excavation sites of Indus Valley Civilization
And specialty of their town planning: andit was basically Sophisticated and Advanced
Urban Culture and it is claimed that the uhIndus Valley Civilization was having the worldâ€™s
first Sanitation system Individual wells andseparate covered drainage over the streets
for waste water and today we have seen thatthere are several drains that do not have
really cover in the our country at this momentAnd houses opened to Inner courtyards and
smaller lanes so that you can really go andthen do that And impressive Dockyards granaries
and ware houses and brick plat forms and protectivewalls And massive citadels were available
at that time to protect the city from floodsand attackers all houses had access to water
and drainage facilities
And besides this it is believed that cityplanning might had taken place through certain
government agency as it calls for elaborateorganizational work because the city was planned
in a very organized manner therefore somebodyshould be there to have that uh city planning
And if the city was really being planned anddeveloped then naturally there will be large
number of experienced people like architecturedesigners masoners carpenters plumbers and
laborers etc must be there That means thereis a system which was prevailed at that time
And light geometrical and surveying instrumentswere found in these cities during excavation
like what I have shown here like this is acompass kind of things and these are the some
balance systems and of course the threadsand there is a kind of a stand for this thing
for putting this balance for surveying purposesthis instrument is used for surveying and
also labeling purposes
So Indus Valley Civilization if you look atthere is a development of cities it is believed
that cities grew out of villages that existedin the same locality may be for around 100
years And it grew in its size and densitythat might be surrounded by several small
towns and big villages The cities might haveinterlinked by trade and commercial activities
and social relations etc and large land areasfor agriculture rivers forests and rural communities
were surrounding the each city that meansthat this agriculture and rivers and also
forests at the time forest used to give theproducts which will be useful for the day
to day life And which is a part of their cityparticularly outskirts kind of things may
be and which is is the need of the hour alsolike that means each city should be self sustainable
and we can learn from this
And if you look at classification of townsthe small villages or hamlets around 0 to
around something 10 hectares and large towns10 to 50 hectares and cities around 50 hectares
and 1 hectare is around uh something 10000meter square And if you look at these are
the cities which were there in Indus ValleyCivilization that Mohenjodaro is around 200
hectares in size and people were around something35 to 45000 people were living this estimation
And Harappa was 150 hectare in size 23500people were living at that time And similarly
all others of course the Rakhigarhi and thenGanweriwala around 80 hectares in size Of
course Dholavira was a little larger around100 in size and Rehman Dehri is a smaller
you know you can say it is a town kind ofthings which is something 12000 people were
living So these are of course in a size basedon that they have come up with some population
uh I would like kind of things
So what will be doing will be basically lookingat Harappa Civilization and topology kind
of things If you look at the Harappa is basicallynearby this place which is uh Ravi by the
side of Ravi River and it is an extended overa circuit of 6 kms on the left bank of river
Ravi in the Punjab province of Pakistan Pakistanof course the new name today earlier it was
a part of India And around 23000 people wereliving in that area and the city might have
been developed earlier during the Kot Dijiphase maybe 2800 2500 BC And earliest city
coverage of an area of 25 hectare Later onmight have you know grown to the larger in
size And it became a center for trade networksextends to Baluchistan and Afghanistan Afghanistan
is here in this region might have spread andwest sea coast in the south and towns were
built over the raised mud brick platforms
And the high mound at Harappa is surroundedby a massive mud brick city wall with a large
square ramparts And of course these are thethings you know what uh people could see even
today and because the remaining are thereand uh today of course that uh you know you
can see that other things like a tomb of Muslimsaint you know you can uh today see that because
after that people have a uh you know use thatportion also
So if you look at this is the what you callexcavated uh lay out what people got in that
region you can see that is the area moundarea they have classified in various areas
there is a fortification here and there isa Harappan well in this region Of course later
on people might have built this mosque lateron and a tomb and this region is basically
Ravi and Kot Diji and there is a circularplatform here and this we call is a mound
F which is granary and for storage space forthe grains And this is the uh this area is
basically might be the place where king orthe administrator might be staying in this
region and this is the Harappan town And thisis the your river Ravi and of course now it
is a dry bed And if you look at people gotalso some pottery clans here evidence of pottery
clan and they are thinking that mound E isthe craft area and there is a cemetery in
this region
And of course uh there is a uh perimeter wallvarious walls remnants of the walls they could
see from various regions and uh I mean theyhave excavated these regions and they have
located several remainings of the structures
So if you look at uh this Harappan Town Planninghad a citadel mound with a square towers and
bastions and lower town as I told uh are asI had shown you earlier that surrounded by
massive brick walls and it had large openareas inside the gateways which might had
used as a market or check point for taxinggoods coming into the city these are all hypotheses
or a kind of things what people have madeAnd it had clusters of houses outside the
city walls which might had used for temporaryrest stops for travelers or caravans If you
look at basic house plans is a single roomtenements and houses with courtyards Even
if you look at to when we discuss about ruralhousing courtyards were earlier a part of
rural housing and houses if rooms on 3 sidesopening into a central courtyard
Nearly all large houses had uhh private wellsthat means if it is a large house the person
must be rich so therefore is having theirpersonal well for water And people found also
the Hearths like uh may be brick or stonelined fire place which was might be used for
the cooking purposes or people says that itis for the Poojas also and for Yagnas and
for maybe another things will be heating andit was common in every rooms And bath room
in every house with a chutes leading to drainagechannels that means the water will be going
out to the channels for drainage And firstfloors of bathrooms were also built that means
bathrooms were also built on the first floorAnd there is a brick staircase was provided
as access to the upper floors because thereis a two storey houses what people have conjectured
And houses built with perimeter wall and adjacenthouses were separated by a narrow space of
land Unlike today all are uh houses are youknow joined together in most of places And
granary with the areas of threshing grainswhich will see as you go along see some of
pictures Burnt bricks mainly were used fordrains and wells and bathrooms while Sun dried
bricks were used mainly for fillings Timberswere used for flat roofs like uh I had shown
you earlier that culture of having uh youknow flat roofs with the timber and mud might
be there at that time and which is still theretoday in this country particularly in rural
areas
Harappan Architectures if you look at uh thebuilding materials wise they were using mud
bricks baked bricks mud means basically itis a dried sun dried bricks and wood and reeds
Average size of bricks were found to be 7into 12 into 34 centimeter 7 will be height
and then this is the width and this is thelength 34 cms and 10 into 20 into 40 centimeter
for city walls and larger bricks have alsostandard ratio of 1 is to 2 is to 4 so if
we have to look at this is the ratio is 1is to 2 is to 4
And mud bricks baked bricks and wood or stonewere used for the foundation of walls of the
houses Doors windows were made from the woodand mat house floor uh were made out of hard
packed earth or the soil basically And evenin rural areas we do use uh today particularly
uh for the uh in the houses of poor man Forbathing areas and drains baked bricks and
stones were used roofs uh with wooden beamscovered with the reeds and packed clay as
I told that it was uh being used earlier daysLargest buildings made entirely of wood what
people are anticipating I am really concernedwhether how could they say this because wood
might not be there ok and windows the shuttersor the lattice work were being used
Architecture for the large public structuresif you look at large buildings were meant
for administrative and ritual purposes andaccess routes are provided throughout from
one area to another and markets and publicmeetings were held in large open courtyards
Houses and public buildings were grouped withshared walls and uh formed larger blocks and
were accessed by wide streets And most housesas I had mentioned earlier had private baths
and toilets as well as the Private wells
Let us look at the granary If you look atgranary of Harappa is found in Mound F as
I had shown you earlier and it is a brickstructure that was built on a massive brick
foundation over 45 meters north south and45 meters east west If you look at this is
the north south can region 45 meters thisside and 45 meters this side which is not
shown and which which is quite a huge structurewise Two rows of six rooms that appear to
be the foundations these are shown like 12 3 4 5 6 these are all uh rooms of which
will be 7 meters wide I will show may be inthe next figure partly paved with the baked
bricks Uh if you look at this uh two rowsof there is a one row of 6 rooms this is one
rows and there is another rows here right6 rooms 66 12 rooms are there And in between
there is a road this is the road which isaround 7 meters wide apart and which was paved
with the baked bricks
Each room measures around 15.2 uh meter lengththis house will be around something 15.2 meters
and 6.2 meters wide width kind of things andof course it has three sleeper walls with
air space between them If you look at thisis the this one one wall here the other wall
is here and the other wall is here this spacewill be for the air Or this is known as the
air space
So if you look at question arises why thisair space uh being provided at that time May
be for uh what you call maintaining the temperatureas it is a granary may be temperature will
be affecting the quality of the grain beingstored So therefore it might be given and
uh this can also be utilized even modern daysand more research is required for that So
with this I will stop over here and thankyou very much and then we will discuss more
things in next
