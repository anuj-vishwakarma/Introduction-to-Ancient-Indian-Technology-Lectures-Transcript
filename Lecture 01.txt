I welcome all of you to this course that isôAn introduction to ancient Indian technologyö
And most of you are aware that uhh this countryis having a very uhh wider legacy of scientific
heritage and where we have developedů wehad developed technology Unfortunately it
is not being taught in the class nowadaysAnd I was also not aware about this thing
and five years back I came to know that wewere having a large number of technologies
and we our ancestors had developed uhh quitea bit of science which will be helpful
In this course uhh you will be learning aboutlike a what are the philosophy of doing this
uhh this science and technology And beforethat like if you look at like you might be
wondering why this we need to study this thingWhy we need to study the ancient Indian technology
at this moment
And before that we need to ask certain questionslike what do you mean by science how it is
useful Can any of you tell me What do youmean by science Because science is being taught
from the Class 1 onwards What do you meanby that
Science is a study of any object or anythinguhh systematically uhh and in a well organized
manner
Well organized manner Any other answer
Science is something which defines how tolive actually how it is defined how the way
of living
Way of living we can call it as a sciencebecause it is basically we want to know the
governing laws what you know how the natureworks physical laws And those things also
had to be verifiable right That means as uhhthe other person told that it is a systematic
study And also it can be proved that it isright one it is also subjected to scrutiny
So therefore we can say that science is asystematic knowledge about particular field
of study or any field and it builds an organizedknowledge in the form of testable explanation
There should be some logic there should bewhy it is so how it is so right And it must
have some predictive tools Suppose you knowcertain laws or you know rules then can you
predict what is going to happen about thenature about the universe So that we call
is generally science
So science is basically as old as human civilizationbecause man is basically a curious and creative
creature by nature So therefore it is hisdesire to know why it is happening how it
is happening what can be done Like that questfor the knowledge which is inherent in the
uhh human life or inherent with the humanbeings are basis of developing a science So
science is as I told is as old as civilizationand so also the technology But question arises
what do you mean by the technology becauseall of us we are part and parcel of technology
Technology is also is as old as civilizationbecause earlier days what being told to us
that people were living jungles and slowlyand steadily they moved out of the jungles
and settled down and developed the technologyof uhh harnessing the various what you call
food and then shelter and then other thingsto have a life So can you tell me what do
you mean by technology
Technology is something that can support scienceFor example if weůwe haveůearlier times
we have parabolic mirrors to light up aůlightup something uhh even a dry leaf we use a
parabolic mirror
To concentrate the solar light you know lightor the energy and then you ignite it that
is the point you are making right
Yeah right Right
Okay
So something which can support science isbeing defined by technology
That means you can say the application ofscience by which you can develop a certain
product or a process by which you can livea uhh very what you call uhh good life right
So therefore we can say that technology isbasically the practical application of science
to design a product or a process with thehelp of innovative tools
As I told earlier that man is a curious andcreative creature that means innovation is
a part of human life And it also the systemsand when you talk about a product or king
of thing you need to use materials So thereforeyou will have to use tools systems and material
that improve the quality of human life becausealways the man is quest for the knowledge
and try to use it to their advantages to havea better life
That does not mean that we will be leadinga life only with the embroiled with the materialism
right We need to handle the material but materialneed not to be taking away the essence of
life (())(06:26) That is what is happeningnowadays So therefore basically technology
as I told is as old as civilization Then questionarises what is the (diff) you know uhh difference
between engineering and technology Can anybodytell me What do you mean by engineering What
are the differences between engineering andtechnology
Maybe the uhhůmaybe there welfare of societyis involved
No but then what is theůIs it engineeringsame as that of the technology
When technology is used in welfare of mankindand society thereů
No that is always will be there Any any anyknowledge as matter of fact is not only the
science not only the technology but also thephilosophy also the sociology psychology Any
other form of knowledge is for the welfareof the human beings and also the environment
where they live That should be the motto Butunfortunately we do not look at it that perspective
But that is the motto what our ancestor alreadyalways emphasize on that
So engineering is basically a process of whatyou call doing If you look at the engineering
refers to the processes of doing For examplelike I know how to write and our ancestors
were knowing also I mean very earlier Vedictime or some other time you know like later
on that they were knowing how to write Forexample they can take a palm leaves and take
a needle and go on writing inscribing it
But after that the pen came Then I even whenI was a kid we used to use ink and dib the
nip of the pen and then write Later on fountainpen came Then the what you call ballpoint
pen came gel pen came So these are all technologybut the process the engineering is that to
have a pen right Or the process of writing
So therefore this is thing but let usůthisis the way what we define Let us see that
what do you mean by Shilpa We always talkabout Shilpa Shilpa generally means inůis
a Sanskrit word But what we call is maybesome people translate into industry right
When you talk about industry like Shilpa uhhkind of things then we call it basically it
will be involving uhh technology it will beinvolving engineering right
And it also definitely when you talk aboutengineering and technology science always
will be there So let us see what our you knowscripture says about that: ôNanavidhanam
vastunam yantranam kalpasampadam Dhatunamsadhanancha vaastunam shilpasangitamö The
meaning that Ĺnanavidhanamĺ means variouskinds of techniques machines like aůand also
the Ĺvastunamĺ ĹYantranamĺ means machinesAnd vastunam means basically materials It
can be basically products of course you canmake product from the materials and the process
And of course when you talk about materialyou need to know how to extractions kind of
things And (sa) Ĺsadhananchaĺ means transportationyou need to move from one place to another
and also the motion of the components onein a machine one can think of And Ĺvaastunamĺ
means habitats you know like Vaastu Shastrawe talk about that is basically how to make
a building or a hut or a room or a place ora fort So that is together we call it basically
Shilpa
That means it is the combination of engineeringand technology that we call it as a Shilpa
Now when you talk about this science and technologyquestion now arises that why you will be talking
about India And earlier days we call it asa Bharat Bharat meaning basically which is
always aspired to a better knowledge thatis the meaning of Bharat you conceive
And we need to know what is the strength ofthis although lot of uhh young people think
that India is a very poor country and it isnot doing well and we are having lot of problems
or we do not have any strength But no Indiais having lot of strength we need to relook
at it Therefore we are looking at Indian ancienttechnology in this course And this is a very
introductory course what we will be dealingwith because there is a lot of things are
there which cannot be covered in 30 lecturesTherefore I will be giving away a very (())(11:23)
view of the technology which were being developedby our ancestors which were having the proofs
for that
So if you look at this I have shown here themap of uhh India in earlier days Bharat nowadays
in English we are calling it as India So ifyou look at this is the current map what we
are having here Of course this portion isPakistan right And earlier it was a part of
our country India before 1947 And there isalso the portion of the Bangladesh right Kind
of regions here uhh and then uhh before thatwho is a part of the Afghanistan which was
there in ancient time uhh as a part of ourcountry And beside this like Bhutan other
places were there and Tibet those are thecountries not with the India but earlier it
was a part of India
And if you look at that you need to look atthis map which is very important because ofůthere
are several geographical things are thereAnd in this region it is basically Bay of
Bengal We are having a very good coastal lineAnd here in this place we are having Arabian
Seas this region right And we are having Kuchchhlike Gujarat kind of things And there is a
desert area here which is a dry region
And we are having Himalaya Himalaya is a veryimportant place because we are having a icecap
there in the Himalaya and which makes theour country to be cool and maintain the temperature
of this region Trans-Himalayas Western Himalayasif you look at we are having Gangetic Plains
it is a uhh very great fertile land we arehaving which produces uhh you know lot of
food grains
And we are having semiarid region here inthis region And this is a Central Highlands
where we are havingů Lot of Vindhyachalsare there And then we are having also the
as I told Eastern Ghat which is having mountainrange that protects you know our country from
the monsoon wind and so also the western regionit is instrumental for having good rains in
this place
And we are having Deccan Plateau regions andnortheastern regions where we get lot of this
thing and Himalayan region If you look atit is a very great country having a geographically
reach in that And if you look at this is uhhůweare fortunate now to have uhh this country
and we have taken bath here because this countryis having 52 percent of cultivable land as
compared to world average which is 11 percentThat means you know food is very important
because as our scripture says ôAnnapathishtadevaöso food is really very you know important
for our life
And we can get very easily in this place becauseof our country where cultivable land is quite
a large bit And beside this for the food weneed to have our hour of sunshines The time
period of the sunshines in a day in this countryis quite high as compared to the world average
If you go to any other country you know likeit will be less of course Pakistan Bangladesh
these are the our own part and then so alsoAfghanistan
And we are having all 15 major climatic regionswhatever the in the worldwide is there in
this place That is the you know (())(15:26)what we having in this country And uhh as
I told that this is having a lot of climaticregions and very fertile land and lot of rains
water and other thing therefore 10 biodiversityregions are available here Therefore lot of
people even today are coming from outsidecountry and living in jungles to look at our
seeds look at our biodiversity wealth andthen do research and take those components
and again recycle back to us with them; youknow tax with a more money you know like we
will have to pay for that
That means these are the our resources Weare not aware We should aware we should doůwe
should take care of that And beside this Indiahas a largest livestock populations That means
you know like cows goats the domestic animalswe do it is from the time immemorial We always
a part of you know the animals which are helpfulto us and also the other animals We always
believe that man is not only to live on thisearth man is one of them and all should live
together That is the ethos with which ourancestor had lived and that is there in our
psychic even today
So beside this there are several rivers largelyrivers like your Ganga and some portion of
Brahmaputra also and Mahanadi Kaveri JamunaThere are several rivers I mean are there
which are endowed with that And we are veryfortune to have those rivers because they
supply waters and then all those things Andbeside this mineral reservoirs are quite high
like we are having coal uhh storage and whichcan continue even if we use at this rate maybe
another 250 to 300 years of you know coalwe can use that
And we are having bauxite which is havinglarge reservoir that is which we produce aluminum
so also iron zinc and copper and several otherminerals we are endowed with them So these
are the wealth we should utilize Not onlythat India is having 25 official languages
and which is having uhh 1652 spoken languageswhich are being developed
And most of the languages are scientific innature and it develops it you know it help
Itůthose are if are learned properly it canhelp you to develop a good mind Unfortunately
it is not being uhh you know taken seriouslyand learning properly this language and which
must be what you call retained much must beprotected from the onslaught of English which
is a dominating on the other language today
And beside this we are having the very largepopulations and people are here invariably
intelligent and energetic in nature And thatis why they are also corrupted according to
my interpretation right So therefore and theyare not doing well for the development of
our nation because they are not being educatedproperly And education should be done properly
such that they can channelize their intelligenceand the energy for the welfare of the country
and also they can grow
So it is because of bad education becauseof what you call uhh unsupportive government
and social systems by which they are beingaffected they are not contributing But I am
sure if they are educated properly and underthe better leadership and social environment
will improve and we can have a very good niceplace to live that is in this country
So it is having a very good what you call(can) uhh capabilities and it must be harnessed
properly and directed properly so that wecan really do So therefore it is important
to look at our heritage and culture And letus look at what is a difference between basically
I want to give like ancient and present Indiageographically
If you look at India is having something uhh29 sorry 29 states and 7 union territories
Unfortunately some of the states are beingbifurcated in the process of bifurcation So
it maybe more states to come And this is themap which I have shown I mean I need not to
go through all the states And uhh but earlierdays as I told earlier that it isů
I have taken the Mauryan dynasty and whichwas something 265 BC It is having territory
not only the India larger portion except thissouthern portion and then uhh eastern northeastern
portion Like it was having also the Pakistanand some portion of Afghanistan here somewhere
right So it is having a very last territory
And if you look at the uhh chronology of majorperiods and dynasty uhh let us go through
it because it may be helpful for us to uhhget into the technology how it is developed
and where it was developed kind of thingsAnd if you look at 25000 years and you know
before that is known as prehistoric periodAnd uhh of course 3000 to 1500 BC we call
Indus Valley Civilization and nowadays weare calling it Indus-Sarasvati Valley Civilization
because Sarasvati river was there I will beshowing you picture And the major areas if
you look at it comes under that basicallySindh Punjab Gujarat and Haryana kind of thing
And although I have taken this 3000 to 1500BC the period but generally we believe it
is 5000 BC right In our mind it is there Andrecently IIT (Kadak) Kharagpur they have done
research They have published uhh this workin the ĹNatureĺ which is a very prestigious
journal in 25th May 2016 And they have excavatedthe data you know the Bhirrana region in Haryana
And they are claiming that Indus Valley Civilizationnot 3000 years back BC it is basically 8000
years kind of things back right
So it is uhh what you call older than theMesopotamia and that is the claim I wish that
it should be right one And that is the thingwhat is there our mind and it is there in
our scripture also it is trying to prove Sotherefore it is very important that we should
do the research and carry it out And the objectivethe motivation for me to take this course
is to encourage you people to do the researchon the Indology ancient technology and other
thing so that we can find out the truth whatit is
And then 1500 to 500 BC that is the uhh proto-historicVedic period what people are saying I have
taken the data that which is being acceptedworldwide And that is a region is Punjab Gangetic
Plain and Kashmir region where the Vedic periodbut however uhh our scripture say that Veda
is around something 5000 years old minimumthat is the thing (())(23:29) quite old
So therefore more research is uhh you knowrequired to find out the exact date where
we are having the Vedic period Of course uhhthat has been accepted by worldwide what I
have quoted here And 563-334 BC is a historicperiod where the lot of people took bath and
they have contributed I have just mentionedthat about Gautama Buddha Bimbisara Ajatasatru
these are the king You might be aware of GautamaBuddha who was a profound of the Buddhism
and which has crossed which has spreadůuhhwhich was spread over the entire you know
larger portion of Asia and other regions also
Ajatasatru and Mahapadma Nanda of Magadhaand during that time there was a invasion
of Alexander which was being uhhůthis invasionwas being nullified And byůat that time the
King Porus and he was forced to go and havea troops with the the Porus the king in the
frontier regions of India And during thattime there was a stalwart who came up whose
name is Chankya His name also other name isVishnugupta He was instrumental of installing
the Chandragupta as the king of Magadha andwhich have done a wonderful work He has written
also Arthashastra which is something 330 BCto 232 BC onwards
Of course after that Binndusara and Asokacame And there is a Sunga dynasty 190 to 71
BC During that Saka invasion was there butit was repulsed And 320 to 647 there is the
Gupta dynasty which is the golden era uhhof our history what people talk about There
are several kings came up and they did a wonderfulwork like Chandra Gupta I Samudra Gupta Chandra
Gupta II Kumar Gupta And during that timethere was a Huna which invaded our country
And also uhh that was being repulsed backand of course the other kings is Skanda Gupta
Later on of course 1712 to 1192 in northernIndia several dynasty; there is no single
dynasty as such: Yasovarman Pratiharas ofKanyakubja Palas and Senas of Bengal and Chalukya
of Gujarat Kesari of Kalinga and other things
And 300 to 1565 AD in the Southern Indiandynasty there are several kings: The dynasties
like Pallavas Kanchis; uhh of Rastrakutaĺslike in western and central Deccan region;
850 to 1276 Cholas and 1197 to 1323 AD isKakatiyas of Warangal we will be discussing
something about their uhh you know technologiesAnd Ganga dynasty we will be talking about
certain technology of their; 1300 to 1500Gajapati dynasty in uhh in Orissa And Vijayanagar
empire was a very important in the southernside that is 1336 to 1565 So uhh I will stop
over here
Let us now look at what we have learnt Thatwe have looked at what is the science what
is the meaning of technology how it was definedinůbasically technology and the engineering
in our ancient time and what is the importancelike of this country what are the wealth we
are having what are the positive things weare having and then we look at like chronologically
how it is the various periods and dynastyin our history
In the next lecture we will be discussingabout basically how to uhhůwhy we need to
look at ancient science and technology Thankyou very much
