Let us start this lecture with a thought processfrom Mahatma Gandhi According to him to forget
how to dig the earth and tend the soil isto forget ourselves Itís really aptly said
by him that it is important for us to cultivateor do faring ourselves for our own food And
we have seen in the last lecture that howthe modern farming has spoiled not only the
food but also the environment and our ownhealth and also the health of not only the
animals also the other plants And it is havinga very bigger ramification on the entire ecosystem
So therefore it is important to us to youknow look at like how to overcome the problems
with the modern agriculture practices becausewe are in deep trouble So far the food is
concerned so far our life is concerned sofar the (who) entire ecosystem is concerned
because of using the chemical fertilisersan also the modern way of cultivation and
we have created unemployment right and lotof air pollution water pollution and then
soil pollution what not Now what are the solutionsthen how to go about it Any idea Because if
we will not use the chemicals chemical fertiliserspesticides insecticides then what will happen
our production will be going down and at thesame time if we will be using more then we
are spoiling the soil
We are aggravating the problem so what arethe solution then So if you look at for that
reason we need to go back to the ancient agriculturetechnology with a modern outlook Itís not
that we will just copy and paste what ourancestors did and we sustained for years together
We need to also do research on that and findout the ethos behind it and adopt it in the
modern times Therefore it is important tolook at the ancient way of farming
So if you for that let us look at agricultureis as old as our civilisation And you might
be knowing the legendary figure in our puranictimes is Krishna all of you know So Krishna
name itself comes from a root word known asKri ëkrisathi ithi krishnaí that means it
is basically according to me who might havestarted the organised the agriculture and
if you look at little bit and connect thisnarrative These are narratives you need to
connect and he was a potent of the cow rearingthe cows right Not only for milk and also
this thing If you remember that GovardhanParvat you remember that story Govardhan Parvat
that you know where he was having a fightwith the Indra Indra means the person who
will be giving the rains right
That means the irrigation system he must havestarted And if you look at the Balram Balram
was having what plough his brother BalramSo you need to connect see unless we look
at from that narratives in the perspectiveyou know we wonít get it So if you connect
all those things you will find look it mightbe from that period you know improvised agriculture
might have come up using the cow dung forthe as a manure and the irrigation system
and plough and other things you need to connectit I am sure that most of you may not have
this ideas connecting together looking differentway than what tradition is going on
So if you look at there are several storieswill be there also we will have to can tell
us that ours is an agricultural society earlierand today we must be agricultural society
not a industrial society the way we are movingtowards Because food is important and good
food is important as well for our sustenanceand also the sustenance of other animals insects
and other things So agriculture has been aprimary productive activity in India because
that is the primary wealth the rest of thethings are secondary wealth but we are giving
more importance on the secondary wealth whichis not the right thing And evidence from the
very early time now you can get in particularlyMesolithic time late Stone Age phase around
8000 BC BC means Before Common Era right andit is more than that but this is the accepted
fact that we are having
If you look at this picture these are allbasically paddies being taken and then you
look at this one instrument here this personis holding this instrument you know and what
is that can anybody tell me This one thisportion what is that this is an instrument
for cutting ok So similarly if you look atthere is another instrument here right which
is there and there is another instrument Wewill be talking about technology There is
another instrument here Could you see thatThis is another instrument you know there
is another instrument here What are thosethings These are all earlier days people will
be having right
So we need to look at that and let us seethe major aspects of the farming and if you
recall from the history that most of the civilizationacross the globe is basically started where
wherever water is there river basin you knowSo you can think there is a river here right
these are river this is a boat and then thereis a in between some place there is some trees
you know and water is important for your cultivation
So therefore water is the means How to takethis water this is your mechanism by which
you can take very easily because this is alever mechanism It can ease your work input
am I right are you not getting this is a thisplace it will be going up or down and then
up and then that way you will put the waterhere water will come over And then these are
all valves or the gate valves you can saythat gate or controlling valves
Controller I can say and then water can comeover here and beside this of course you can
take some material also maybe some manureor something and you will have to also use
a plough the cultivations and there is youcan carry some collect these materials This
is the sowing if you look at the processesinvolved in that And agriculture if you look
at as I mentioned earlier we will be usinga lot of tools for carrying out the farming
work
And of course the plough is one importanttool as I told so for our narrative goes it
is the Balram who must might have inventedthe ëHalí because he is known as the Haldhar
hal is plough right A person who is carryingwe can call Haldhar ëdharam karta hain tho
usko haldar kehtha hainí You know do youknow that Balram was having an ayudh means
weapon as a hal right
So ploughing is this thing when you talk aboutplantation the soil is important So also the
seeds and then it will be also sowing andsowing methodologies will be discussing about
that transplantations is very important Andlet me ask you a question what do you understand
by the transplantation and similarly whenyou talk about all these process then we need
to also improve the soil by using the manureand fertilisers So the question here is what
are the differences between manure and fertilisersThat question might be coming to your mind
right and we will be using pesticides insecticidesand other things also because always pest
will be there Even in ancient times pest willbe there insect might be there But today insects
are too many because of imbalance in the naturethat time it might be there aslo in ancient
time
So agriculture tools let us look at some ofthem like digging stick So if you you know
go to the history you will find we are havingevidence of digging stick right from letís
say Mehrgarh now in Baluchistan earlier itwas a part of Indian India like Chirand in
Bihar right if you look at and Ahar in Rajasthanand Nevasa in Ahemmednagar since stone age
right I have earlier discussed Stone Age islong time before your Indus valley civilisation
right
And these stick consist of pointed stickswith a sharp edge For example if you look
at this is a sharp edge this one side thisis a sharp edge isnít it this is a sharp
edge and there might be another this is twosides there might be another one here also
There might be various kinds you know onecan get it so that it will be easier for to
dig And this is known as a digging stick andin Sanskrit you know in Vedic literature it
is known as the Abhri right And if you lookat this Abhri is about one cubit feet long
One cubit means basically 45 centimetre Aroundthat and this stands from the elbow to the
finger If you look at the elbow here and tothe finger average you know depend upon the
eight of the person but in Indian system ifyou look at it it will be around 45 centimetre
it can be also 40 you know on an average thatis the thing and this is also people use There
is another instrument what is being used likehere if you look at this is a stick kind of
thing and it is having a cross bar right Thisis your cross bar
It can be made of stone but what evidencewe got is basically you know wood Maybe people
might have stone and then might have usedto wood later on or vice versa I think stone
age if you look at modern way of looking peoplesay stone age first and then later on But
my feeling is that first is the wood thenmaybe I donít know that is a controversy
but let us say that there is a evidence forthat Earlier ploughs were digging sticks decorated
with handles like for example here this isthe handles you know This is your handles
and plough we will see this is the primitiveway of ploughing and handles for pushing and
pulling the things and these thing can usedused both for the levelling of the land and
aslo for digging the holes So suppose if Iwant to put something I will have to dig So
this is a simple tool what people might haveused earlier time
And there is another thing which is knownas hoe and in local language in Hindi we still
calling it as the Khurpi Khurpi if you lookat there are several kinds of course can I
call it as a Khurpi this one this instrumentif you look at What is the purpose That is
we call it as a sickle right and what purposeit will be used can I till it with this I
can but it will be not that easy and it isused for cutting the paddies or sowing particular
sowing weeding Weeding you know if you haveto remove some unwanted plants whatever will
be coming out and tilling of course it willbe difficult But there is another one I was
thinking of bringing and show you becausein my garden this is having this is basically
known as Khurpi in UP even at this momentthis is your Khurpi And this is made of iron
or you call it steel right This will be whichsteel mild steel
This will be made of mild steel and it ishaving a sharp edge this edge is sharp edge
right And it can be used I have used myselfwith this and this is having an angle you
know Like this it will be and there is anend here and then you put it will act like
a lever like with less force and this designwell I have done myself I have used it Itís
quite interesting very simple tool which youcan use in your garden Even somebody claim
that you can also what you call handle the(sma) little medium size land aslo for cultivation
right
So in the Khurpi if you look at stone hoeIt is made of stone aslo it is found in Mehrgarh
and Jatkara in Khajuraho in MP you must beknowing Khajuraho is famous for sun temple
and Naga and Sadhya hills of Assam These wegot from the archaeological excavations we
have already got these things and tool primaryis this tool basically used primarily for
tilling sowing and weeding As I had told earlierand as I told this is a basically sickle which
is a multipurpose you know tool its havinga blade a metal blade narrow blade and this
portion will be little zig zag kind of thingso that it will be easier to cut sometimes
it is sharp also Right and handle is madeof seasoned wood
This is made of wood right this is your handleand aslo earlier these people were using bones
animal bones right that is there but nowadayswe are using wood But those things are there
still today That is the thing whatever itwas there letís say 6-7000 years ago and
today we are having similar stuff going onthat is the thing what we are having And there
is another instrument or the tool which isbeing used is the spade There are several
evidences but I could managed to get thatthing that it was found in 500 BC BC mean
you know before common era I think 2005 yearsback around 2005 years back from now in Ujjain
right
And this tool basically primarily is for diggingDo you know the shape of this spade What do
you call in Hindi the spade any idea Itísknown as kodha right So this will be looking
like you know this is having a handle herethis is made of wood generally and this is
which is connected with that and this is theiron cutting plate this plate you know is
made of plate right You might have seen thesethings right So this still is being used and
comprise of a blade and kind of things thereare several varieties
I will show you another of them which is littlemodern maybe Itís having the same piece here
this is your sharp and this is having a kindof rode which is having sharp here So this
will be when I will use lower portion whenI will use upper portion if I say this is
lower one or one sided in this example whereI will be using and when I will be using see
if the soil is very hard naturally I willhave to use this one Are you getting this
is for hard soil
And one you do I want to take of one placeto another If it is a soft soil or you now
muddy soil like you know not muddy like whatyou are having already being rained and it
became soft so this can be used for used forsoft soil It is easy and also with the help
of this portion right this blade you can carrythe material from one place to another you
can throw right But with the help of thisportion you cannot So you can look at it is
a very good design one can think of you cando two things with the same tool
And ploughing if you look at the ploughingis a very important one right because we will
have to plough the land before cultivationand even after cultivation kind of things
So it is very important as I told this ploughwhich was basically according to our narrative
Indian narrative it might have designed bythe Balram we call him Haldhar So this plough
is being joined you know with this connectedthis is your plough right and it will be having
a pole which will be connected to this ëbhelíor what you call the ox two oxen and then
it will be tilling the soil or the land Andwhen you do that you will get something like
a reach here and this is like a furrow Therewill be like a drench sorry trench and this
is the reach it will be helpful
Why we do this ploughing that is the questionwhat might be coming to your mind Is it not
that I will take the seed and throw and thenit will be germinated and it will be done
why should I do that Are you getting thesequestions So we will be answering these questions
if you donít know but think about it lateron and if you look at this is this furrow
What we call in Sathapatha Brahmana like thatis from the Veda right they consider this
furrow is like the womb in which seeds areto be sown right like in womb we will have
to put a seed similarly they consider that
In Vedic era people were having the understandingwhat really it is having right of course they
have written a very little cryptic way Andthat is another evidence if you look at the
Milindapanho there is a dialogue between theking Menander and the Buddhist monk Nagasena
around 100 BC and who emphasised the importanceyou know and the requirement for a successful
crop that is basically well ploughed landis essential for successful crop For getting
a bumper crop you need to plough it That meansplough is important that dialogue is there
and how to do and what are the things Thereis also Sambakrta in Panini
Panini you know like who has given the grammarwhich is very scientific of course there are
several grammar book but Panini grammar bookis known as Astadai that means Astadai is
written by Panini he has compiled lot of thingsand he has used this term which provides basically
ploughing to be done one end to another Thatmeans if there is a land you will go from
one end to another and twice and second timein the reverse direction that you will go
this was and come this way Right then onlyit will be the right one So what I am trying
to do is basically I am giving evidence thatlook it is as old as our civilisation that
ploughing is going on
And there is another book which is known asKrsi parasara even I think 50 years back people
were using it religiously Unfortunately nownobody knows about this book but this was
and thereís a local version also ether localmeans if you go to Tamil Nadu it will be having
different version but most of the things aretaken from here Krsi parasara and other things
and that recommends ploughing to be done 5times in a year
For having two crops basically you have todo 5 times kind of things and it is believed
that first ploughing gives wealth and thethird the desire of what you want and 5th
which give the rich harvest which is importantSo thatís why ploughing plays a very important
role for that But very important thing ploughingwhat is being prescribed that that ploughing
much be restricted to same means 14 angulates10 inches around
It should be less than that and why it isso why not more than the way the tractor does
you use a tractor and its machineries forploughing right the land tilling the land
then it will be going very deep Why canítwe do the deep this is old one therefore he
will be you know the tenants will be not rightActually it is not that means the modern way
of tilling is no right you should not spoilthe top soil When you do plough what is happening
the top soil will be entering into the nextlayer of soil and top soil is very important
for the cultivation right And our ancestorswere aware and they have also given the precision
that you should not go beyond 10 inches modernthey are talking about ëangulasí right
So that is the thing what whereas the modernpeople were not aware till recently when there
was problem people are finding out why weshould not use tractors and then other instruments
ploughing instruments devised by the modernpeople and we are now seeing that look they
were knowing where you know long time backour ancestors So that is very important But
why I didnít tell you I am leaving that foryou to think and explore but as I go along
we will discuss As to the Jathaka story manísprosperity depends on the number of ploughs
being purchased by him right
That mean more the plough will be that meansmore the land he can manage to till right
That is the thing one can think of that meansprosperity Prosperity in getting the food
producing the food not in you know gettingthe other things secondary things because
the farming or the crop farming or the foodis the first primary wealth you know kind
of thing So that was being emphasised Thatíswhy our culture whenever we think ours is
basically agricultural based country thatis the reason Let me just show you how this
is going on plough
Of course you can look at these videos andsee that Can you see that you know this is
having a ëbhelí and this is a one kind ofplough which is there and it looks to be he
is not doing anything very nicely its doingand he is making furrow and ridges If yo look
at let me again this is making furrow andridges kind of thing very easily Of course
let me tell you it is not the raw the soilor the land it is already done a layer Therefore
it looks to be very easy ok Donít think itis that easy And he is just not doing anything
Just holding and then going very easily rightBut it is being already ploughed and he is
doing second time So there for you know itis look to be easier
And we will be looking at also some partsof that And let is look at the plough means
you know how does it look And the plough youcan get you know in a Terracotta sculptures
we got it I mean this is the terracotta ploughwhich is made of mud Terracotta is made of
mud ad this mud is being baked right rightThis is basically baked mud made of baked
mud And we got this evidence from Banawaliin Haryana the place and which is quite old
And Vedic term for plough is ëLangalaí orsome people call it also Sira but there are
two things what being used in Vedas one isLangala this Langala is meant for ploughing
or breaking the ground but Sira is for sowingkind of sowing plough you can say Like suppose
I want to have you know put the seeds thenyou know you will do something to put the
seeds very easily right And Rig-Veda in Rig-Vedaaccording to Rig-Veda the plough is made of
wood with smoothen handle and sharp pointedshare
So you might be thinking what this is Thisif you look at there is a handle here right
This is your handle and this is a plough rightand this is of course the pictorial Let me
show you another picture this is basicallya figure which is indicating you know ploughing
is being done so this is the thing is yourhandle or the grip right This one will be
grip or handle you can call and this is yourshare body and this would be pointed In Vedic
era the wood was being used This would besharp enough to pierce into the ground the
soil and Atharveda refers to ploughing doneby 6 to 8 oxen This is really very of course
difficult to digest because what we are usingmaybe two oxen or 4 oxen I have not seen 6
to 8 in my lifetime
Of course I am not exposed to the rural environmentand most of you might not have seen Nowadays
tractors are being used And this is of coursethey are saying for hard soil That means more
force is required That may be the reason AndRig-Veda passage refers to the use of horses
for ploughing and that is a very differentthing because Rig Vedic or the Vedic people
were very fond of horses and at the time theywere using for ploughing ok So the oxen would
be coaxed gently not to be treated harshlyyou know Today you might be finding that people
are very cruel to the animals They might be(())(3212) also that is why they are being
asked not to be cruel to them but to takecare of them and gently coax you know so that
they would do the work for you
So and there are various kinds of plough youcan design you can think of this is one kind
of plough and this is another kind of ploughIf you look at this is your handle Similarly
this is another kind of plough and this isanother kind various designs you can get across
the country But unfortunately nowadays itis very difficult to get plough because most
of the people nowadays using the tractorsand the tillers you know for tilling the land
And let us say that as I told that Vedic erapeople were using the wood as a ploughshare
right and when did iron ploughshare replacethe wooden one that we will see In pre Harappan
period something 4000 to 3000 BC axe madeof copper was used for agriculture work right
and that is being you know discussed and whetherit is how they arrive that this is one question
coming to the mind you know But however thereare several axe I have shown you Here you
can just have a look at it
During Harappan time wood and stone ploughs were excavated were also
found and out of which agriculture instrumentsor the tools If you look at 19.2% instruments
were made of copper Iron you know was notreally being used in Harappan period till
now people are not having that evidence andbronze were used in Agricultural work 88%
were axes therefor they are deducting or theyare thinking that axe might be used for the
cultivation because the numbers are more
And 3.4 % hoe I have shown you hoe I had shownyou varieties of things and sickles is 4.2%
and 4.2 % is ploughshare which is very verysmall in percentage That might be the reason
why they are saying that the axe might beused you know for the cultivation purpose
because Harappan civilisation was dependingon the agriculture And 5 types of axes it
can be flat it can be shouldered splayed narrowsplayed or long narrow and this is another
one whether you call it axe or not but I thinkwe call in Hindi is (())(3515) right This
is you know flat like this surface like thissurface here and then this will be also sharp
in this side so that you can use and thisis being used nowadays for making roubles
out of concrete because it is having a veryforce you can do right
And it can be used also for hard which onehard soil or the hard groud it will be used
And this is of course used for the cuttingpurposes and then if you look at this 5 types
axes where used for the digging digging purposesIf you know they are found in Chalcolithic
of the central India and also Deccan Deccanregion you know Tamil Nadu and Southern part
of that portion and Neolithic and Chalcolithicof the South India And besides these you know
lot of ëparsuí like we are having a legendknown as Parsuram who was the might be the
first person to have a parsuí I guess andparsu looks like this Parsu is also used as
a weapon for fighting war you know
That is and the Khurpi I already talked aboutKhurpi earlier which is nothing but a hoe
and ploughshare made of copper in assemblyThey have several things they have got it
And in Atharveda if you look at volume 3 and17.3 you can get Langala is described as a
ëpaviravatí Pavira refers to a sharp edgelike ëvajraí Vajra you know what Indra used
to use that is this weapon it is made of veryhard steel and which is made of iron ëAyomayaí
means Ayo means basically iron in ancienttimes and fixed at end of the plough for tearing
the land right And Panini mentions Paninimeans the author of Asthadai grammar Sanskrit
grammar
And he mentions about ploughshare which isalso known as ëkusií made of iron and in
Vedic language it is ëayovikaraí right Sothat means we are getting a lot of evidence
that we are having this in ancient time aswell and ëKokalika- Sutraí is basically
in the Vedic text you can get This is in Suttanipatait is a Buddhist text refers to ëphalaí
Phala is basically being heated and makinga sound when dipping in water What is the
meaning of that That basically you are temperingit right and making it hard the iron and this
process was there in where If you look atthis is something around 200 BC So it is not
a new thing what we are talking about it isvery old in our country and Mahabharata and
Manusmriti described plough consist of ironblade and wood
This is ëKastham Ayomukhamí that means Kasthammeans wood Ayo means iron mukha means the
front there will be iron That mean it looksto me during the Manu and the Mahabharata
that or maybe Buddhist period rather rightthe iron has come into as a plough that is
the evidence what I could get Of course itis a debatable thing But however if you get
something more you can tell me so that wecan have a discussion to find out And it is
being accepted that iron plough was used somethingaround 1000 to 800 BC
Of course little bit before the Buddha EvenBuddha is 575 BC So 4.8% of the agriculture
assemblage contains hue sickle parasu ploughsharefrom Jakhera region in Himachal Pradesh Because
people excavated and they are getting thiskind of you know tools for the agriculture
So with this I will stop over here and thewe can see that what are the various components
of the what you call plough and then fromwhere we will get the evidence that ok how
to design a plough
Because if today you will go to the farmerof I do not know I just do whatever earlier
but we are having a design I will be talkingabout in the next lecture that we are having
design which is having related to the a textwhich is very well known for the agriculture
So with this I will stop over we will againdiscuss about it and look at also various
aspects of farming and what we need to doThank you very much
