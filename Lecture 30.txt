Let us start this lecture with a thought processfrom Gautama Buddha who says `As irrigators
lead water where they want as archers maketheir arrows straight as carpenters carve
wood the wise shape their minds’
If you recall that in the last lecture webasically discussed about the ancient irrigation
system which were different in the variousregions of this country And unlike in the
modern days where we are using the same canaland then dam systems for irrigations And we
need to learn from that that each region willhave different way of water conservations
and also the water irrigation systems Andwe also looked at various reservoir systems
which were very huge and were built by joiningthe rivulets in a very what you call nice
ways that it will not harm the people aroundthem
So today we will be discussing about morereservoirs let us look at Pakhal lake which
is basically situated around 50 kilometreseast of Warangal And you might be knowing
that Warangal is very basically the capitalof the Kakatiyan Ruler Ganapati Deva who is
around 1213 built this lake which is artificialnature in the area of around 30 kilometres
and it provides a very beautiful site Andof course there is a Pakhal Wild Life sanctuary
around this lake which is covering around839 kilometre square area it is a very huge
So from the environmental point of view thisis the great things what we have still kept
and it will be good to have such kind of waterbodies for the betterment of the environment
And let us look at another lake which is quiteold that is Ramappa Lake and this was again
built by the same king Ganapati Deva Uhh ofKakatiyan dynasty around 13th century He was
very much interested in having to build atank near the temple and that temple is basically
Ramappa temple which was built around 1261
And the lake was built at a distance about1 kilometre from the temple And lake is spread
over an area of 82 square kilometer and providesirrigation to 10000 acres of land So this
was a tradition of the medieval king and alsobefore that we had seen that they were very
much concerned about the water conservationand also water preservations for the users
And it was around the temple not only thetemple also in cities they were making that
And let us look at another very interestingUhh water tank that is Sahasralinga as its
name indicates you might be thinking lingamis basically Shivaling and that is a lot of
Uhh you know small small temples order ofyou know 1000 temples were there around this
tank And again it is a medieval artificialwater tank in Patan under the patronage of
Siddhraj Jaisinh around Uhh 1093-1143 CE whois a Chalukya Ruler of the Gujarat
The tank built by him was basically receivingwater from Canal of Saraswathi River and this
canal had spread about 500 kilometres withgood stone masonry embankments And as I told
earlier there were thousand Shiva Shrineson the edge of this tank And if you look at
like some of the pictures I have shown herelike these are the canals which are having
and these channels are having if you lookat these are all brick stone cladded kind
of things and there is a also the water inletsthese are all water inlets which will be coming
out kind of things there is staircase
And this earth work circumscribes an areaof several kilometres and the width maximum
width may be around something 1 kilometreAnd total area of this Uhh tank water tank
is around 17 hectares it is a very huge Itis estimated that when it is full it would
have you know contained around something Uhh42 06500 cubic meters of water On the eastern
side there is an evidence of Uhh waste weirchannel measuring around 18 meter width and
28 meter in length
On the western side there is a very huge templefor Shivji and which was built with the Uhh
around I think 64 columns of made of stonesnow it is in dilapidated condition And Uhh
towards the western side there is a rudrakupa; kupa means basically well in which water
from from the river Saraswathi was collectedfirst and then the water will be allowed to
pass into the inlet channel of Sahasralingatank And this kupa is about 40 mtrs in diameter
It is quite a huge well they had built.
The architecture of this tank integrated thegreat sense of water management and sanctity
of water in Hindu tradition Because we alwaysconsider water to be divine therefore you
should use it sparingly and also conserveit that is the message what we should get
from this and it was a tradition of our countryand also our Uhh way of life if to Uhh Uhh
consider the all these natural things as divineSo unlike in modern time when we misuse it
abuse them profusely
So let us look at the Prashar lake which isa basically ice clad mountain areas in Mandi
of district of Himachal Pradesh and this lakeof course is known as natural one this one
is known as Prashar lake and during ice itwill be there and there is a temple here you
know a pagoda type temple three tiered pagodalike temple and dedicated to Prashar And this
is a natural lake what people have used andlet me just emphasize that earlier days our
you know people were finding out the naturalplace of storing water which is much easier
I had emphasized and also gave several examplehow they used to join the rivulet which is
coming from the mountains and also the makethe dams as less as possible unlike in the
modern time where people use Uhh what youcall dams in a mechanical or the brutal way
without really thinking much
Let us consider the another reservoir thatis Daroji reservoir and it was basically originally
built around 1600 CE that is common era hasbeen used ever since it has been built and
the Uhh figure I have shown here Uhh whichis of course today it is not in good shape
Its embankment is more than 3.6 kilometrelong and height of around 12 m Uhh it had
a elaborate stone sluice gates Uhh I meanwhich is shown here one of them is shown here
this is there will be a sluice gate throughwhich you can control the water and it is
having architectural of the Hindu temple contemporarytemple kind of things
Unfortunately this was being used Uhh by thepeople local people before the building of
Tungabhadra dam in 1958 because this DarojiReservoir was fed with runoff water from 3
seasonal streams from Sandar Hills As I toldearlier that they were collecting you know
these streams and then making reservoirs togetherAnd water pool is around 1.5 into 4 kilometre
square which used to increase to 2 into 5kilometre square in rainy season
It was used to irrigate around 1639 hectaresof agriculture land in around 1886-69 as per
the record of British government During thebuilding of Tungabhadra dam people from 95
villages were displaced And this Daroji UhhReservoir they have kept but they are merely
fed from a canal from this Tungabhadra damSo therefore the naturality of this Daroji
Reservoir is lost in the process and thatis the beauty of our ancient reservoir system
Uhh being built
Now let me talk about a little bit about howthe water being managed in the forts of you
know ancient India Because people were havingthese forts for protecting themselves and
guarding them And one example I will takeonly and water harvesting in the fort of Chittor
Rajasthan you might be knowing the that Chittoris a very famous it was been captured by several
people and the Rajputs had a registered andalso recaptured this fort several times starting
from Khalil’s to Akbar periods And thereforelots of stories Uhh are around this Chittor
fort but later and it is one of the largestforts of India And it is has been declared
as a UNESCO heritage being a largest and thenvery beautifully designed
Let us look at from the water harvesting pointof view It is having 500 hectares of land
which was devoted for harvesting water Whatpeople had found out something this fort was
having 84 water bodies out of which only about22 exist today Today means may be 20 years
back or 10 years back I do not know right
And water bodies basically consists of pondswells and step wells right And as the these
ponds have natural catchment areas they alwaysfind out natural way of doing the thing And
the wells and the baories baories means basicallystep wells located below these ponds such
that the seepage will not be lost If thereis a water seepage is going down and it will
be store there
40 percent of this Uhh you know land weregiven over to the water bodies That was the
design what they were using Today we are notconcerned about that whenever we are making
a home or a buildings we should have openspace for the water particular rain water
to seep into the you know ground and thenwe can use it By considering the depth of
water around 2 m only around 4 billion litersof water can be stored With this water you
know if rainfall is around 700 mm of the heightand army of 50000 could live in the fort for
4 years That means one seasonal rain can lastfor you know 4 years to Uhh meet the needs
of 50000 people And of course by consideringthe water losses due to seepage and evaporation
other things right
So if you look at the design of the fort andother things where considering the water need
of the people and also future anticipationthat was a good thing we can learn from this
kind of you know studies And it is wheneverthere is a tank or the water reservoirs even
the embankment in the rivers there were peoplewere planting the trees And this practice
of planting trees on the bank of tank andrivers were there since time immemorial because
trees and other things are part of our livesAnd if you recall the famous dam of Sudarshan
Lake was strengthened by planting trees onall its banks during the Rudradaman 1 which
was restored in 150 CE
In Andhra the rows of trees called Kattavawere planted on the side of tank bund bund
means embankment And not only in Andhra otherplaces people do I could recall there is a
one book written by `Aaj bhi khari hai talab’by Mr Anupam Mishra who just passed away who
was one of the pioneers in what you call UhhUhh in revoking the traditional knowledge
for water conservations and he has done wonderfulwork and we should Uhh go through that and
learn and then apply those things in our Uhhday to day life also
So if you look at these are the pictures whichI have shown the lot of trees around that
This is the pond and similarly of course theseare from I have taken from South This culture
is still remaining in the south but unfortunatelyit is receding at an alarming rate Generally
fruit trees and other trees Uhh which areUhh you know needed and also Uhh that arrest
the soil erosion due to the flood or the youknow being planted Certain trees contain certain
amount of tannin that adds sweet taste tothe water and can be helpful in cleaning of
water of its impurities while making waterpotable
So those knowledges you know which a partof our Ayurveda and other things can be utilized
Uhh for water purification and also addingthe sweet taste to the water So it is a win-win
situation kind of having which will make strengthenthe earthen embankment and also it will add
the you know some kind of a Uhh chemicalswhich will be helpful for the natural chemicals
which will be helpful for Uhh what you callput make the water potable
So we had a very brief discussion about canaljust to prove that how the various different
kinds of irrigation system were used in ancientIndia different parts of the country it’s
not the same system But now we will discussa little about canal systems in ancient India
Canal system of irrigation which is basicallyknown as `Kulya’ in Veda exists in India
since Vedic period and which were dug usinga tool Khantira Uhh is basically a tool which
is used to do it artificially It is not onlyin the Vedic period even like Indus Valley
Civilization we are having canal systems andwhich I had shown you earlier a diagram for
that
Kautilya who is the basically author of Arthashastraclassified the countries making water channels
for crop as a kulyavapanam In Sanskrit literaturenala nalika pranali are used for the words
for canals In South India the Vaykkai in Tamiland Kaluve in Telugu denote canals Of course
the pronunciation might be distracted by mepardon for that And several networks of canals
either from the river or reservoirs duringancient times are still being used for irrigation
even in recent time
And all channels broadly can be classifiedinto 3 categories which were Uhh One is Feeder
channel; other is Inundation channel and Springchannel So Feeder channel is basically this
is being used to feed water from the riverto the tank and so that also it can to the
field right and this is done artificiallyAnd among many canals in South India we will
discuss about two only because you know thatdue to the paucity of time
And during Pallava period Uhh Parameshwaravarmandug canal from river Palar to feed the Parameshwara
tataka basically it is a reservoir near theKanchipuram Rajaraja Chola around 985-1013
AD dug canal from river Kaveri to feed thetank near village around 10 miles away from
Tiruchirapalli which is being used even todaySo these are the 2 examples I have taken Uhh
just to elastrate that the feedal canals werethere in ancient time
And Inundation channels we have seen in thelast lecture that about how it was being used
in Bengal and it was studied by British engineerduring Uhh what you call British era And generally
the shallow cuts were made through the riverbanks into which excess water flowed when
the level of water in river rise above certainheight during flood that we have seen earlier
And during Pallava period Uhh NandivarmanPallavamalla II records indicates that a new
villager dwellers were allowed to build Inundationchannels what they call it as a Vellakkai
in Tamil on rivers Vegavati and Palar wereallowed for irrigation of their farm land
They were allowed to do that and that meansthere will be some provision for them to do
not all people will go and have a Inundationchannel so otherwise it will create anarchy
in that
And the Spring channel which is Uhh in Tamilknown as Urrukkai and Uttakalva in Telugu
So deep furrows were made on the river bedsand collected waters are channelized to the
fields for irrigation and drinking purposesalso These are a smaller one but the Inundation
channel will be spreading across the wholefield so that is silt will be taken from the
rivers to the field which will be acting likefertilizers during the Inundation They will
be allow flood to go; basically that is ideain Inundation channels
And Pallava records indicate that donors wereallowed to dig the Spring channels - Urukkai
on the beds of Palar and other rivers Thatmeans you know like a people were donating
the money for that and for the general purposesAnd that kind of attitude is very important
that means they are taking care of their groupof people
The Canals in Ancient India: If you look atlike will be looking at another kind of Besnagar
channels which is a in the river what youcall masonry canal of 7 ft wide and 5.5 feet
height of length of 186 feet built around300 BC Uhh which was excavated on the western
bank of river Bes at Besnagar near Bhilsain Gwalior These are of course a you know
historical data which is there.
And brick masonry walls of canals was plasteredwith superior quality of lime mortar If you
look at the water is passing through thatthat means it should not Uhh you know dissolve
Uhh with the water which one the lime limeshould not be dissolved in the water therefore
it should be very hard enough like your cementand other things modern days that it should
be Uhh remain intact with the flow of wateron its surface
The flight steps at the middle of south wallof canal and cross wall joining the north-south
wall suggest several uses of storage of waterwith the application of lifting devices Water
lifting devices I won’t be discussing Butthere are lot of evidence water lifting devices
were being used in our country and using variouslever system and even water wheel was being
Uhh you know Uhh used in ancient time
So Uhh Kumarahar canals: And this canal of43 feet wide and 10 feet depth located 3 kilometres
away from the east of Patna railway stationwas basically dug during the Mauryan period
It is a very old kind of canals And the Ancientcanal near Ujjain: This brick line canal of
8.5 feet wide at the bottom and 150 feet lengthwas excavated partially near the river Sipra
People also found out a big pond like a naturaldepression located at one end which indicates
that it can be a feeder channel of irrigationI mean which goes back to something Uhh you
know Uhh very ancient time
And Nagarjunakonda Canal: which was of 50feet wide and 6 feet depth and its length
is around 2400 feet was constructed with hardlime stone gravel on its embankment and the
floor But today we do not know how to makethis hard lime stones in local manners Of
course you may get something from the companybut this knowledge is not with the people
they are rather with the company It also useslarge size bricks of extremely durable natures
And that shows that you know they were havinglot of technologies which were available at
that time
So Uhh let us look at Kaveripumpattanam canalwhich was excavated Uhh in Uhh recently and
this is one of the most notable ancient Cholaports and which is located at the confluence
of river Kaveri and the Bay of Bengal Thisis nearby the sea which is still being used
Uhh this is the canal systems and this isthe water which is passing through from the
Kaveri And this is the very good corbelledpeople have made this cladded with the the
bricks right
The water reservoir at Vanagiri located around1.6 kilometres from the sea was made of earthen
bund; these are basically earthen bund andwith a façade built of bricks These are the
bricks which are being you know joined togetherAnd it was designed with the two corbelled
as I was telling these are the corbelles rightcorbelled surface arch to receive water from
the Kaveri river to inlet pond So this kindmay be is a pond kind of things right And
small feeding channel from the Kaveri Riverfor the irrigation purpose may be for drinking
purposes they might be using So these arewell Uhh what you call design whose remnants
are still Uhh there after so many years ofneglect and other things
So with this we will stop over we have seenthat there was a very Uhh great tradition
of making canals and water reservoirs Uhhfor Uhh using for the irrigation purposes
and also for drinking and other water otherpurposes and we in the next lecture will be
Uhh also looking at how to control this flowof water in the canals and how they are doing
Uhh that things and thank you very much
