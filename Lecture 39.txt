We can start this lecture with a thought process“you can create your own life as an artist
sculpts a deity by metal casting” And todaywe will be basically discussing about metal
castings in ancient India
A question might be coming into your mindwhat do you mean by metal casting Metal casting
is basically a manufacturing process by whichan object is made by pouring molten metal
into a mould And of course Uhh the castingis considered to be the mother of all production
And Uhh we know that intricate statutes whichare being used as an Uhh as idols for our
worship for worshipping purposes are madeof casting alone And Uhh if you look at the
process involved in metal casting is verysimple
What one has to do is basically metal themetal and then you will have to prepare a
mould like that what I have shown here andpour into it And once you pour it will start
solidified due to the cooling effects Butit must be done properly And then of course
you will get a product So in a simple wayone can say that Uhh casting having 3 processes
Basically melt the metal and pour it intoa mould and let it freeze Of course it looks
to be a very simple but it is no that
If you are not careful about making the propermould pouring it properly and Uhh the solidification
also should take proper manner otherwise lotof faults will be there in the casting And
the casting methods are Uhh broadly dividedinto two categories One is expendable mould
casting and another is nonexpandable mouldcasting And some of the example of expendable
mould casting are sand casting plaster mouldcasting investment casting and others In case
of plaster mould casting the plaster of parisbeing used But sand casting is quite old and
it was being used in ancient time And we willbe more discussing about the investment casting
which was being used in ancient India profuselyfor making the statue
The non-expendable mould castings Uhh in whichthe mould will be used you know used continuously
some of the examples of die casting continuouscasting and centrifuge castings And this casting
is not related to only the metal It can beused for making glass even we use the concrete
Uhh buildings you know concrete slab and otherthings we do use casting And keep in mind
some of these techniques also will be discussingUhh during the glass making process
And let me just talk about little bit aboutthe terminology what is being what are being
used for metal casting And I have shown hereand here a mould and this is having a what
you call this are the fan mould will be givenAnd this is having what you call a flask for
a body of that in which you will be preparinga mould it is having two halves like Uhh there
is a parting line here This is the lower partis known as the drag and Uhh the upper part
is known as the cope Of course the side viewof this entire mould system is being shown
here And which is having cast Uhh a metal
And this portion is the pouring cup throughwhich the metal will be poured It is having
a conical shape And then of course slowlywhat you call pipe decreases and this known
as downsprue And after that the metal willbe flowing through the runners and there is
a riser also in which the molten metal willbe kept stored such that it will be going
slowly into the Uhh Uhh cavity in which themetal will be casted And there can be a core
Uhh inside this thing being placed so thatyou know Uhh some hollow things can be made
out of this casting
So this Uhh if you look at Uhh terminologywill be using therefore I thought that I will
introduce Of course there are more terminologiesNow when you will be learning more about casting
metal casting you will be learning about it
So Uhh let us look at now that Uhh about theancient way of making these Uhh statue what
I have shown here You may have seen this statueThis is a dancing girl which of Uhh which
was Uhh obtained during the excavations inMohenjo-Daro in Sindh Question arises how
it was fabricated It is having a lot of featuresIf you look at these are bangles and these
are Uhh jewelleries Right And Uhh its havinglot of complicated structures like nose eyes
and other things How one can make this isa very important aspect one might be coming
to your mind
So Uhh and this is basically being made bycasting and which was Uhh considered to be
Uhh manufactured around 4000 BC That meansaround 6000 yrs you know years back And this
of course the size looks to be too small ifyou look at the today’s Uhh world That is
around 11cm high bronze dancing girl likethis is made of bronze And Uhh besides this
artefact there are several Kilns Uhh werebeing identified in that excavation site in
the Indus valley civilization-Mohenjo-daroMehengargh and other places And also other
parts of the country Uhh later on of course
For these kilns are considered to be usedfor melting copper silver gold lead and others
during that era And besides this metal castingtools were also obtained in Uhh this site
And some of this what you call I have takenfrom this paper and this you can see this
image is from which area
So Uhh let us look at now the metal castingin ancient India I will be just giving Uhh
bird’s eye view of the Uhh a Uhh What youcall evidence But it is not just what you
want Uhh if you look at the Rig Veda and YajurVeda has provided a brief discussion description
about the metal casting And Uhh Rig Veda mentionedthe casting process and tools used for iron
smelting Beside this there are several Uhhtext are there Let me quote 2 Sanskrit text
One is Shilp Shastra and Anthsarvasva whichyou people might be aware by this time And
it has really documented the metal castingprocedures in a very intricate manner in a
very exhaustive manner
And Uhh shilp shastra you go if the as thename indicates it basically Uhh deals with
the sculpture making And when you talk aboutsculpture making is a statue idols and then
tools and other things And charak sanhitawhich we have discussed several times mentioned
that not discussed really And Uhh in thatthe process of making sculpture and idols
if gold silver copper tin are being mentionedAnd then they have talked about a process
known as lost waxs casting process
And in modern times it is also known as theinvestment casting And Uhh besides this evidence
there are some of the earlier coins whichdates back to 400-700BC were Uhh manufactured
by casting methods techniques as a dendritestructures Dendrites basically tree like structures
And Uhh there are several also other textare there but let me mention another very
important text which is known Abhilashitachintamani written by Saumya Sharad III of
Kalyani Chalukya dynasty around 1200 CE Whichhas given a detailed account of preparation
method of wax pattern slurry coating and provisionof sprue riser runner like whatever we have
discussed in the terminology of the castingmodern casting Those were have been mentioned
in that book
Uhh if you look at the Shilp shastra theseare the tools which are being used The Cupala
which is in Hindi or in may be Sanskrit dhamatriThat is basically a furnace which is being
used to heat the metal and also Uhh for likeUhh foundry work And Crucible where Uhh you
know on the part which will be used for Uhhmelting the metal and this is known as the
Crucible is also known as a Dharma NamayaAnd blow air is of course is known as Bhastri
This air blower we have seen in iron Uhh duringlike when we are discussing about iron making
And these are of course the tools of courseUhh beside this there are several other kinds
of tools like a tong Uhh and other kinds oftolls are were being used
But what is important for statute making isbasically the proportions or taalamana Right
And stance what we call mudra these are anexpression or the bhava These are very important
which is a part of an art And you should havea feeling for that to Uhh you know Uhh sculpt
in such a way that you will get a good statueSo therefore it is a combination of the technology
and the art which is Uhh you know which wasbeing used for making this Uhh making the
statues So that is a very important pointyou should keep in mind which is not that
you segregate it separate the knowledge rathercombine it and make a product of it
Uhh now we will be discussing about a wheelshaped amulet Uhh which was exavacated in
the Mehergarh which is located in the Baluchistanunder Pakistan This is the place We have talked
about Mehergarh several times Right And theseare all Indus Valley civilization or now we
are calling it as a Saraswati Sindh civilizationAnd which is around 4500-3600BC And this Uhh
wheel-shaped amulet you know is shown hereit is basically the front side And if you
look at it is now rusted because it is madeof copper And Uhh question arises how it was
made It was made basically 6000 yrs back
And it consists of 6 small rods These arethe rods you know if you look at the rods
here lying in a ring This is the ring 1 Andthe diameter is of course too small 20mm still
then how they might have manufactured Andthis thing Uhh what you call researched well
by something around 7 scientists from westerncountries And they have published this work
in Nature communication on 15th November 2016And they have used very sophisticated instruments
like Uhh highly spatial dynamics auto-luminationillumination imaging techniques to reveal
lot of metallurgy about earliest lost waxcasting object this amulet And I would urge
you people to study and look at it I willbe Uhh just Uhh you know mentioning about
it
Let us see that how they have fabricated thisamulet which is which was one of the oldest
rather the oldest among all the lost wax castingproducts made in ancient time across the globe
So Uhh they have also not only Uhh you knowtaken studied extensively they have also made
a model Uhh Uhh of this same thing this amuletAnd Uhh they have used something wax this
model and rod of Uhh circular diameters Andthen they have made it into 6 things and then
joined with a ring And this Uhh what you callmodel is created first
And after that they used some kind of clayand put it this thing and model mould is prepared
out of this model And of course like Uhh asI told that this model is made of wax which
can be melted easily at a very low temperatureas compared to the metal So these can be heated
such that Uhh you know this Uhh this modelcan be meted out and then the shape will be
formed And after that you can Uhh pour thismolten metal through this sprue And Uhh then
the metal will be going through all the placesand then solidification will be occurring
And this is the piece what they got Of courseafter that you will have to break this mould
you know after it Uhh it solidifies completelyAnd then you can Uhh get this Uhh metal casted
amulet And this is the thing what they gotyou know which is rusted one what we had seen
this one Now they have also looked at thisUhh casting from this process and like take
a smaller portion and then investigated usingthese modern techniques Uhh of imaging And
Uhh as I told earlier this is basically waxand this is your clay clay kind of thing throughout
And they looked at a small portion and tofind out what is happening during solidification
process They have found that you know thereis a dendrites structures when the temperature
is Uhh between the 1085 to 1066 degree CelsiusThere is a dendrite growth of metallic coppers
and of course oxygen will be around maybe0.3 percent And this will be Uhh starting
there and then subsequently what happenedaround something Uhh 1066 degree C cuprous
oxide and copper right eutectics are formedAs a result the liquid phase solidify into
Uhh this cuprous the saturated copper
And also a copper and cuprous oxide rod-likestructures if you look at these are the rod-like
structures which have shown here And thisphase subsequently what happens like Uhh this
low final metal structure crystallo-dendritecopper is all being made Uhh being made throughout
this domain And suddenly oxygen saturatedcopper Right If you look at these are basically
the red one - this one is a cuprous oxideand this Uhh yellow one is basically the saturated
copper
As a result they get a rod-like structuresalso cuprous oxide But in the finally that
is what is being now Uhh you know one canUhh what is actually artefact for what is
being what is 6000 years old The people arefinding something copper oxi-chloride phase
within the dendrites While the saturated copperfully oxidized to the co Uhh cuprous oxide
within the co..
eutectics And this as a result this eutecticUhh cuprous oxide is preserved And that they
have found out of this and they have alsoUhh mentioned that this is the oldest you
know artefact or the product of which wasmade Uhh by the lost casting across the globe
And that means it was made in India basically
And Uhh of course there is a lot of gap betweenthat techniques and which is how it is propagated
from the Sindh Uhh from this Indus valleycivilization towards the south and other parts
of the country But what Uhh literary evidenceUhh suggest that you know that again there
is a arousal of this technology It might havemigrated from that towards the south But there
is Uhh metal casting art got started in south-Indiaaround something 600 to 900 CE by Pallava
dynasty And this of course attains peak duringearly Uhh Chola dynasty like 900-1300 CE And
Uhh of course this Uhh think was being Uhhbeing propagated and also supported by the
Uhh king at that time
As a result there is a confluence of cultureand abundant resources around Tanjaver-Kaveri
delta region And attained its peaks in termsof technological development combined art
with the science what I was mentioning earlierThis is a very much what you call amalgamation
of both art and science together And thisis the region the Tanjaver region where you
know it was being developed in earlier time
And Uhh if you look at I have taken 3 figureshere Lord Natraj Lord Natraj’s statue is
quite intricate in nature I will be discussinglittle more about it in the next slide And
this is the Lord Vishnu Uhh statue which isquite intricate in metal is a marvel of metal
casting so also Uhh the goddess statue AndUhh I must tell you that there is a lot of
research is going on about the dancing ofUhh the lord Shiva Right And which is Uhh
very famous And then one aspect want to bringto your Uhh attention that Uhh lot of like
Uhh astrophysics Nirupama Raghavan ex-directorof Nehru Planetarium had done research and
connected these star positions of orient constellationsto the image of Lord Natraj due to paucity
of time I will not be discussing But you canexplore that thing
And beside this Uhh there is a book knownas Uhh Tower of Physics by Freed Di’ Capra
Who has mentioned about this dance in theUhh from the scientific point of view you
can look at that And Uhh if you look at thisNatraj sculpture which was Uhh you know like
being there and being worshipped in varioustemples But the Chidambaram is the very important
Uhh you know temple where in the city of Chidambaramand Uhh in Tamil Nadu Which you can see it
is quite intricate And this figure shows thatdance of Uhh Lord Shiva
And this dance is not ordinary dance it isconsidered to be the cosmic dance of Lord
Shiva And this statue is made of bronze andyou can see that there is a aura parallel
of the flames which are here These are theflames with Uhh between the left leg and pressing
the upper samara with the right foot and displayingthe grace with hands And this statue is really
very intricate from the point of view manufacturing
But lot of mythological things and also lotof science will also be involved in that For
example some of the scientists have observeda marked similarity between this dynamic moment
of particles in the sub-atomic universe andthe macro-cosmic dance of Natraj Uhh I think
some of us should look at this aspect andcombine with the manufacturing and you know
how it was a confluence of the art and scienceand also spirituality in it
The origin of artist impression of Lord Natrajis due to the Pallavas of South-India as I
have mentioned earlier Of course later onit was being carried forwarded by the Cholas
of Kaveri-delta region in South-India alsolater on other Southern kings also Uhh took
it ahead
So let us look at like this Uhh casting inthe South-India which is still going on Uhh
in a very pockets of the South-India Uhh asa family business or as a family enterprise
But it is dwindling out But the Natraj andVishnu casting of Pallava and the Cholas intricate
casting Uhh you know was very much popularin medieval India And this Uhh casting was
basically also made out of Panch-Dhatu itis a alloy of copper zinc tin gold and silver
We call of course in English lost wax processbut in Sanskrit it is the Madhi-chista Vidhan
Vidhan means method or process
And as mentioned in Shilpratna and Manasaraand later on of course Uhh this kind of things
propagated to other parts of the country Itlooks to me it has taken a cycle That means
from the Indus valley civilization it mighthave come to the south side After that it
has gone also from the south to the northSo it might be you know Uhh these things It
clearly indicates that this method of castingthat is the lost wax casting is an Indian
nationality identity particularly during 10thcentury
Let us look at the processes involved in theinvestment casting Of course the Uhh is one
has to make use this wax model Right And ithas to be sculpted Sculpted means very intricate
part has to be done and it can be done byan artist or what is being known Tapati They
should have a go hand good mind to do thatintricate phase in the model itself which
is a very Uhh you know easy to manage easyto put the Uhh easy to place the shapes
And then this waxes are being generally usedform the beehives or Vriksha-Rasa a resin
from the tree or the cooking oil also peopledo use or a combination of all three And that
it clearly indicate it is organic in natureAnd Uhh each model is unique because it will
be done by artist and not by a machine Thereforeeach statue will be different and it will
be having different also the expression Andwax model gets liquified in the process Uhh
as I old no two state are the same
And this is a very very pain-staking job andit takes lot of time This model takes around
1 to 4weeks And once Uhh make this model andthen you will have to make this moulds and
then you will have to pour the metal and allowit to cool And it takes times And rules framed
in Shilpashastra and Agamashastra texts arebeing followed very strictly for manufacturing
this
Let me let you little elaborately like asI told that Uhh that Uhh model is being made
But after that this wax model is to be coatedwith natural river clay or maybe some kind
of Uhh what you call layer has to be placedso that the metal will not come in contact
with that And then fine grades clay from theKaveri River is being used in Southern India
but in other parts other materials can beused And Uhh coarse sand includes additives
charcoal oil and cow dungs like some of thethings you can mix and do that It takes again
3 to 4 weeks for drying period so that itwill be to know ensure that everything is
fine
And then de-waxing is done for that cow-dungis being used as a fuel for de-waxing And
once the de-waxing is done then you will haveto melt the metal in a crucible furnace suing
the wood charcoal or the sometimes coal asa fuel Nowadays of course people are using
gaseous fuel energy And Uhh this mould hasto be pre-heated before you pour this Uhh
melted metal And then subsequently it willbe cooled and Uhh after that Uhh solidification
is occurring in a natural way And once youget that you will have to break this mould
and then Uhh chisel it file it and also polishit to get the intricacy But one has to be
careful that intricate shape should not beyou know Uhh spoiled in the process of filing
and then also the also the polishing
So let me just Uhh show you a video whichis Uhh I have taken from the internet Look
at this is the wax which is then mixed withthe material and then you will have to make
this Uhh kind of a shape and then intricatewax being formed And if you look at this is
the statue of Lord Uhh Lord Vishnu which hecan prepare and he can make a model like that
which is being shown here with all intricateshapes and lot of things has to be done And
he is rolling his wax into some form and lookat that how he is using the hand and also
the little small tool to make the hand
Means the fingers of the hands so nicely youknow with a mudra postures Then you will join
with that and then of course lot of work hasto be done on this And this is the artistic
work one has to Then he has toe the mouldbeing prepared out of this And it has being
dried And Uhh being placed properly And somelayer will be given And it is placed on this
portion And then of course that is anotherthis is a Natraj statue what is coming up
And it has being fired that this wax beingdrained out of this because of pre-heating
and then the space been created for the meltedUhh metal to go in and you got the statue
which is a Lord Uhh Shiva and Natraj whichis quite complicated
You know out of just one casting he couldmanage to do of course you can come off course
this is another statue which he is showingYou can see that process It looks to be very
simple but it is very intricate complex andtime-consuming requires lot of patience
So Uhh lot of research work has been donebut I will show you some of them That is compositional
element analysis of Chola casting And about130 Chola Uhh casting were analysed And Uhh
out of which 80percent are bronze that ismade of copper and tin rest are brass copper
and zinc And Uhh of course they are alloyedwith lead to facilitate casting People have
used And Uhh their proportions are fixed passedfrom one generation to another generation
And this is kept as a secret This technologyis kept as a secret so also the you know the
material composition And Uhh as many as 28Chola castings had 7 percent tin 7 percent
lead and 2 percent zinc of course rest willbe carbon
And this technology was also being flourishedduring the Vijaynagar dynasty 13 to 14th century
And they had lower tin composition 2.5 percenttin and 3 percent lead And this gradually
transition of this Uhh method of producingstatue Uhh took place from South North India
passing through the Vijaynagr Nayakas Marathasto Northern India to as far as Nepal and Pakistan
So I told earlier it has taken a one circleaccording to the present interpretation
And let me show you the compositions fromthe pre-Pallava time which is something 200
CE to the 1800 You know till this Mughal Uhhtill the British people even till the Maratha
periods it was continuing if you look at copperwas the major one Also the zinc percentage
varies from dynasty to dynasty And of courselead will be there which is for Uhh easing
the cast or facilitating the casting processRest of things of course sometimes tin is
also there right depending on the what theyneed And others are constituents which are
Uhh may be part of the impurities of the metalWhat they will be getting or ores they will
be getting
Let me talk about Uhh bronze chandelier of800Ad If you look at like Uhh the Kumar and
Saxena et al had prepared a detailed reportof lost wax casting method used by trials
of Baxter Chattisgarh region by producingvarious bronze and brass objects If you look
at like Uhh the technology basically werewith the people who were being neglected by
us Like Uhh low-income group people tribalpeople and those technologies are still continuing
And with the modern education I think it isjust going out Nobody is interested to take
keep that technology with us which is indigenous
Let me show you this bronze chandelier whichis quite complex There is an elephant two
person are sitting these chains are thereand there is a dancers and then you know if
you look at it has been claimed that thisUhh this chandelier was made by the lost wax
casting around something 800AD in one pieceincluding the chain with one mould How it
was possible It is a really mind bogglingproposition to say this Even in today it is
not possible to do that
And we need to do more research and how itcan be And if it has been done really great
thing So Uhh there is a claim by some of theresearchers that Indian metallurgy science
and investment casting was transferred toEurope through the Portuguese explorer around
1400 CE But I am having little doubt Uhh aboutthese things But however Uhh you can explore
it do not take it as it is We need to havemore evidence for that Why they are saying
They are saying that Uhh the head of the Papalfoundry in Rome around 1400 a Uhh CE his name
is Vannocio Biringuccio
He has been quoted as saying that “the artof casting is closely related to sculpture”
Of course he has told lot of other things“It is highly esteemed it is a profitable
and skilful art and in large part delightful”So this is the ethos were what Indians were
having Maybe one can say that ways but moreconclusive evidence are required to talk about
Let me discuss about another very interestingUhh casting Uhh methodology which was being
Uhh evolved in our country particularly formaking Bronze coins of several quantity at
that time For that Sharma and Bhardwaj andlater on Mukherjee and Lee have described
about this casting system made of terracottadiscs for making number of coins simultaneously
It is like a mass production of coin
Let me just show you that this is the Uhhyou know Uhh mould assembly what is having
And if you look at these are the coins Uhhmould what is there It is having both what
you call this is having a central sprue hereThe metal will be poured in this and it will
be coming to that everywhere And these arethe small runners which are there to all these
discs will be going So Uhh if you look atthis looks like a 123 4 5 6 7 8 8 you can
get in 1 this thing in Uhh 1 plate itself
This having a cope and drag if you look attwo of them this disc are stacked to form
a Jhari type mould there is a mould this isone on top and other is on bottom this stack
The stack is carefully packed from all sidesThere are several kinds of stack will be there
Right It is packed form all the sides Uhhin a sand moulding bar This is your sand moulding
bars And the metal is poured Uhh as I toldearlier through the central sprue And molten
metal is entered into this places throughthe runners
When it will be entering it is important thatsome Uhh what you call Uhh cavities you know
some air vents will be provided such thatair from the cavity these are the cavities
Right Uhh right cavities will be going outso that you will get a very good coin without
much you know problem in that
So Uhh let me talk about another very interestingthing which I got Uhh I mean yesterday only
That is the Metal mirror craft of AncientIndia The evidence says that the flat circular
tanked mirror made of low in tin around 10percent bronze metal were found in Quetta
Harappan region and Dholavira around 2000BC And this work basically what I am saying
I have taken from Sharadha Srinivasan andI Grover and article which was Current Science
I have given reference here you can see Itis quite a complex this thing
And the Uhh today it is being Uhh what youcall being fabricated in Kerala in a village
known as Aranmular And this is very famousknown as Aranmullar Mirror And Uhh which is
in Tamil and then in Malaya known as ValakanadiAnd was used in earlier days as an auspicious
article Uhh during the Asta Mangalayan thisis known as even the Asta Mangalayan or Asta
Mangalam is Uhh even used not only in theSouth even in the eastern side And Uhh this
tradition is was continuing from the around100 to 200 CE as we have got a something from
chain motile tablets which was Uhh in theKushan period And it included a mirror as
part of Astamangalam set
So this mirror metal mirror basically wasused as a part of our culture And interestingly
Uhh the tradition of making this externalmetal mirror of delta high tin around something
32.6 bronze still continue in Aranmular villagein Kerala But it is about to die out soon
because people are not interested in doingthat
And it is so interesting and also so goodthat one should think of why one should not
continue it And this I have shown you a oval-shapeUhh bronze mirror of 7cm long This is your
around 7cm and thickness is 3mm and it ishaving hardness of 500vpn which is Vicker’s
pyramid number and which is much higher thanthe steel And of course it has been described
how they made it and which I will not be discussingdue to the paucity of time And they have used
basically crucible cum mould The mould willbe here and this is the upper portion is crucible
They will be melting it here and pouring itand doing that
And interestingly what they have done thatthe cooing is also done by the clay cooling
which is a fast cooling they will have todo an inverted this thing after Uhh casting
it so that that whatever you know maintaintemperature will be maintained around something
540 to 350 So that this delta phase of thisinteresting alloy will be maintained And during
the polishing process the hardness also increasesSo the delta phase as I told earlier that
in this interesting alloy is optimized byclever casting and polishing process such
that it is converted into silvery colour andhigh hardness mirror
Of course the temperature the melting temperatureis around something 750 degree C But however
they will have to maintain this temperatureand you will be mixed so that you will get
hardness So if you look at the mirror is youknow skilfully manufactured using low technology
and organic and common materials whicheverwill be there to produce a sophisticated high
technology end products And that was a traditionwhich is going on from 2000 BC till today
but it is about to die
Now it is not only with this metal mirrorbut it is with a lot of products because when
I was a kid like you and I had seen in villageslot of small scale industries were going on
or we call you know entrepreneurs who weredoing this metal casting across the country
But today you will not find them they havegone with the time And as a result they are
coming to becoming labourer in some otherplaces instead of becoming entrepreneur So
let me just tell you that we need to revivethis technology and also improve it such that
this product can be made and it has to bealso Uhh can be documented properly and more
research is required Thank you very much forlistening to this lecture And in the next
lecture we will be talking about glass makingin ancient india Thank you
