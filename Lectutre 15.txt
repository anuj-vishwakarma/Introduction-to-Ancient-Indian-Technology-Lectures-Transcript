Let us start this lecture with a thought processthat is nowadays we are doing chemical farming
which is unnatural unnatural farming couldlead to the annihilation of very life on this
beautiful earth as food is the linkage ofall lives Because through food all lives are
linked and let us start discussion on thetodays lecture by recalling what we had learnt
in the last lecture If you recall that westarted with the types of soil in the modern
realm and then we have we had looked at thevarious kinds of classification of soil made
by our ancestor in the scriptures based onthe odour colour and taste
So and some of this present day classificationare matching well with the ancient one that
is quite interesting And also one of the soilwhich I had mentioned last time which I was
having doubt that is blue soil But I talkedwith some other people people say that do
exist but is very rare That means this bluesoil was mentioned in the ancient scripture
not in present day So therefore they had havinga lot of observation and then we moved into
the How to you know quality improve the qualityof seed how to you know take care of it
And then today we will be discussing aboutbasically how to sow the seed Sowing method
because sowing of the seed is very importantfor agriculture If you look at this S R Rao
one of the researcher who had identified thefigure of seed drill on an Harappan seal from
Lothal region And if look at what is thatseed drill that means there might be a hole
through which it will be seed will be beingsown to the field
And this Harappan practice is known as line-sowingmethod they were using using a seed drills
there will be kind of things So that it isa very good thing to have that at that time
okay and of course you can broadcast the seedbut that is not in a very natural way you
can throw the seeds scattered around And iflook at this Harappan kind of things you can
find the furrows reveal a grid of patternrunning at the right angles to each other
you might be remembering I had shown you somefigure We will see that that is North-South
ones having an average distance of 1.9 metresand East-West around 30 centimetres right
kind of things Let us get into this one andthen we will see that
So if you look at this I had shown you thisfigure this figure is basically from the Kalibangan
Rajasthan which is criss-crossing you knowthis is something 1.9 metres around that If
look at this distance you know this is theEast-West side 1.9 metres kind of thing This
is something 30 centimetres And and moderndays also people are using that means from
the Harappan time Indus Valley Civilizationwhich is around may be something 3500 BC I
mean that kind of things and this still existingtoday right
So that is the thing what we have writtenthat kind of agricultural practice And I am
sorry I had told you this is basically North-Southis 1.9 metre and East-west is 30 centimetres
I You know like you should keep that in mind
So the current practice at Kalibangan in fieldssuggest what Suggest the mixed crop Mixed
or inter cropping kind of things which isbeing used nowadays also with this advent
of new what we call organic farming basicallyit is a natural farming And natural farming
method was basically went from India to otherplaces Now improvised and coming as a organic
farming to this country at this moment right
This is the mixed crop what do you mean bymixed cropping Any idea let me show you what
is that this is basically if look at I canhave this is a furrow and these are the ridges
And there can be onion it can be sugar caneand it can be you know some other kind of
things together you will be having the cultivationright
And so also wheat it may be having some gramsyou know kind of things together Why you will
go for it Because they will be complementingeach other and also that knowledge is very
much essential which will complement eachothers that is a very important Beside this
if you go to any forest you will find thereis a very big trees and there is small tree
Various kinds of trees will be living together
Means nature various kinds of trees and thenplants will be having symbiotic relationship
And that is the things what our ancestor hadlearned and also we are having that in psychic
That means you should have a symbiotic relationshipwith among all all are connected right and
that is ethos is very important Although inmodern time we think man is only creature
which will live on this earth no man is oneof them they all are interlinked And that
ethos that philosophy and the thought processis very important to have And that is reflected
in our ancient agriculture as well right andit is going to the you know Indus Valley Civilization
So what I was telling Horizontal furrows forthe sowing one crop and vertical for another
one can think of and varieties kind of thingif you go to any natural forest not man made
one Today man is making forest you know thatis an unfortunate right It is the nature should
make and we should preserve it You will find5 layers of the trees which are mixing together
There is a we call it Covering 5 layers ofcovering I will be talking about that little
bit later on We call it Achchadan or mulchingokay
So that our ancestors had you know observedand then they were trying to understand the
nature and do that As you look at most ofthe technology today even we try to mimic
the nature But we should do in a positiveway not spoiling the nature in the process
So that is the very important point of whatkind of technology we need to develop right
and that philosophy is important
So which I am emphasizing again and againso that you will not get swayed by the modern
philosophy of consume more and produce moreand then you know and then disruptive technology
those things you should not get swayed bythose are basically market forces who are
doing for their own greedy to satisfy theirgreed
And what Rig Veda says: Harness the ploughfit on a yolks now that the womb of the earth
is ready to seeds therein right Rig Veda Ihave given this you know Rig Vedas Chapter
10 and 9.23 And of course how to interpretthis is a you know Aiyer interprets as sowing
the seeds where sowing the seeds either sownin a plough furrows or broadcast as I told
earlier then covered over by ploughing whywill do Some of you might have sown a seed
or a plant right or saplings right saplingsyou might have done And when you do what you
do You put a sow a seed make a little youknow hole kind of things or you put the seed
and then put the soil on the top of it andthen give the water am I right
So also for the plant why do we do that Becausethat is a things which is very much essential
and this is going on and we are doing it Andthat is so that you will give you know cover
to that and it will not get spoiled and itwill be enough for it to germinate Because
you need air you need not only air moist airyou need also not very heat but enough heat
to have that temperature to have that andalso the ingredients you know
So Aiyer interprets that way covered by theploughing and Rig Veda 101.3-4 says Attach
the sera spread apart yolks right and sowthe seeds into the prepared womb right That
is been ploughed when you plough you knowyou add as shown in the picture that you know
Soil will be getting up and there will besome trench kind of thing furrow
And which according to J. Bolch who triedto interpreted it he says Siram sera is basically
plural word and Siram is a singular occurringin the passage as the plough used for sowing
seeds and it implies that the seed drill ploughwas used for sowing of seeds you know if look
at when you are ploughing itself you shouldhave a mechanism you know first it is ploughing
and then you know you put the seed there
So both the work been done not that you knowanother person has to do But now it is separated
people are using some machine for doing thatI told it is already clubbed in our ancient
time together okay Sometimes you will onlyplough sometimes you will plough and also
put the seed and it is covered So that isa very you know good techniques of of sowing
right
So in Anguttara Nikaya like which is a Buddhisttext the expression of Bijani Patitthapeti
is explained as a meaning planting of seedsSo we have already see in Vedas now it is
a Buddhist text and in Jains say Nayadhammahkahaoand that is a relevance to five paddy grains
being sown on the well prepared bed right
And I am not too sure about why five may besome of these together they will be doing
and seedling being transplanted twice or thriceright this is transplanted you know you will
take from one place to other right I willbe discussing about it later on And then that
is very essential particularly for rice Andwhich is being that means this another text
is saying that this is essential to how tohave a sowing the seed
The usual practice according to the SatapataBrahaman is again from Veda was to sow the
seed after the field had been ploughed Thatmeans it been ploughed properly and then you
will sow the seed
The Panini you might be knowing the authorof Ashtadhyayi grammar book which is a very
well-known and mentioned the term BijakarotiWhat is the meaning of Bijakaroti Which is
of course Saha bijena vilekhanam karoti Seein Sanskrit word even our Indian languages
we are having Samas Of course it is in Hindibut in other thing you will be knowing It
would give a meaning detail meaning of a wordbut unlike the English where you will have
to remember you know like kind of things
So this is basically a device by which a cultivatorsow the seeds in the line of tilling through
a cone attached to the pole of a plough Likemeans you know there should be a whole cone
and then you put it And it is a very naturalway Cone if will there it automatically will
go down once it will go Once will be fallingdown then it will go And you will have to
give little jerk may be to do that you havea control over that okay
And there is another text Medhatithi basicallyit is the comments on the Manu Smriti Manu
Smriti you people may be knowing that is avery important scriptures in our Indian scriptures
And also refers to the seed being sown withthe help of the plough That means plough is
required for putting the seeds on the soilor the land
So therefore plough is been given very importantit can do a plough thing and also put the
seeds and so that you are having and of coursethis is another aspect which has to be taken
care particularly the weeds had to be removedfrom paddy field between Sravana and Bhadra
These are the months in our Indian calendarwhich you people may not be aware I guess
You may be acquainted with January FebruaryMarch and something like that These are very
old calendars and Sravana and Bhadra And ofcourse the Bhadra water water means you know
at that time some scanty rains will be thereAnd should be drained off and be kept up to
the roots only for keeping paddy free fromthe disease It says that this rain if it will
be there then you have to remove otherwiseit will spoil the what you call the paddy
particularly it will cause the disease
So these things has to be re-looked at becausenow there is a climate change okay So therefore
whether it is right or wrong one has to seeand change accordingly because always as I
told for cultivation three things a farmershould know soil season and seed right So
these three S is important So therefore theseason also is important
And as I told there is a sowing method thereis another one is Transplantation and the
term Ropana and Ropeti occurring in earlyPali literature you might be aware that in
Pali language the Buddha texts most of theBuddhist texts are been written right and
refers to transplantation
And Kalidasa which you might be knowing heis the famous poet and Raghuvansam that makes
an apt reference to the seedling of Sali beinguprooted then transplanted at another place
That means you have to take one place anddo that So what is the Sali Sali is a any
idea Sali is basically very good quality ofrice or you can call Dhan basically right
And which were at that time famous Today alsoit is very much there but you know also being
sought after
And as I mentioned earlier that Krisi Parasaraalso emphasize on the process in cultivation
and also had given details of paddy cultivationIt represents a procedure of transplantation
(Ropana) right and of course there is a variousverses are there one has to look at it It
envisages the sowing of seeds for transplantationIt classified seed into two first type plants
which are sown which are later transplanted
For example here this person is been plantedNow he is taking and making this kind of a
bundle right to be transplanted I will showin in the next slide what is the process of
transplantation And whenever you sow thatmeans you know that sowing should be free
from the defects right while sowing But oncethis plant and you want to take you can also
check the quality of the plant what is whatyou want to again place it or transplant it
So therefore this is also the transplantationis attended maladies you know whatever the
problems will be having that should be setaside and the right one has to be
That means a person has to have a knowledgeabout which is right and which is wrong you
know Of course with the experience me andyou like that we cannot really do that because
we do not have experience of transplantationor looking at this thing So therefore it is
very important to have that domain knowledgenot only the domain textual knowledge but
the practical knowledge
So for transplant (seedings) seedlings arenot to be gathered from full grown paddy plant
as all seedling grown hard in the field rightit will be not fully it will be small one
that you can go and put it And seedlings hadto be transplanted one cubit you know from
one another in the month of Sravana Sravanayou know it is the rainy season basically
towards the end of Sravana and Bhadra endright that is a rainy season
And it should be one cubit one cubit you knowyou remember it is something 0.45 metres approximately
because it is from hand form this elbow tothe fingertip is known as the one cubit And
half cubit in the month of Bhadra that meansif it is Sravana it will be one feet if it
is Bhadra it is half feet and four fingersapart in the month of Aswini
Now why it is so What a you know so if lookat Sravana it is a little earlier right So
that may be the logic but more scientificstudies need to be looked at it So therefore
if you give and then if it is a 1 feet andit may grow further you know so that you are
have enough space between this things to havea sunshine and other things right So that
is the and other another important thing thatyou also want to collect it for collecting
it will be easier right Earlier these peopleused to use their hand and then used the sickle
to cut it and then put it Nowadays of coursepeople are using machine
So therefore it should be you know collectproperly cut it and then collect properly
therefore it might be one reason but theremight be several other reasons okay Agriculture
suffers loss due to weeds that of course mostof us know agriculture produce from which
weeds are removed becomes very fruitful veryhighly fruitful That means we need to remove
these weeds
But there is also mention that these weedsonce you remove you can actually use for the
mulching purposes also right and that willact as a manure for the other things And it
is not only about the plants which will betransplanted it is also the trees can be transplanted
it is you know that is mentioned in this textand this is known as Sankrapanaviropana right
big trees can be and after plastering themwith the root up to the branches with ghee
Usira is one kind of gram kind of thing andthen sesamum sesamum is what we do call Til
I think I have shown you picture earlier honeyyou know and Vidanga is a one kind of again
seed kind of things and milk it is known asKsira and cow dung
So if you look at all these materials areavailable with them and you do that But let
me tell you recently in IIT-Kanpur peoplehired some agents to have these big trees
to be replanted and they were saying it isa great success and then it is technology
has come from outside of course they theywere using the chemicals and they paid a lot
of money also because we do not have thatknowledge and this has to be also checked
whether it is true today or not
This for example these ingredients whetherit will be useful or not nobody are using
these today that is the unfortunate part Thereforethere is a need to re-look at it and check
whether this is this recipe or this methodologywhat is given here is useful today or not
or is it you know apt for this work or notright that has to be and they paid lot of
money and also those chemical what they areusing that may not be the right one because
it may spoil not only the soil but also thetree right but whereas these are all natural
things So therefore according to my judgmentthis may be the better one if it will work
for us right
So now let us look at this transplantationprocess if look at these are the small plants
of the let say it can be paddy or the thingand these people are making it you know removing
it from the soil and then making a bundles
And these bundles are taken and then placedif look at there is a distance or something
given also but that distance is not havingand is lot of water of course according to
me like water is not the right although itis easier to plant it But however too much
of water also bad for the you know plantationor the crop
So we will be looking at the mulching Mulchingis a word is nowadays being very much used
because of you know popularization of thisorganic farming any idea what do you mean
by Mulching is basically we call in HindiAchchadan In Hindi we call it Achchadan means
Covering right the way we cover our body withthe clothes similarly when you do cultivation
you have to cover the soil with somethingright ad that is basically layering up agro
materials on the surface soil in the fieldBut unfortunately particularly the western
people and Indian also because they do notknow Indians today do not think they just
follow
So therefore they are using also plasticsand other things for the covering of the soil
which is not good according to me When I amsaying I might be wrong but according to my
understanding it is not the right one
So there are various kinds of mulching youcan get but I will be concentrating only three
which are where there in our text so thereforeI will be considering them But nowadays it
has come various ways
So soil mulching types which you do basicallywhen you plough Then you do that with the
ploughing will put this soil you know topsoil will be removing and then putting it
back and it will be doing Question is whywe will be having what do you call mulching
putting the soil There are several reasonsfor that one of them it will be making little
you know passage for the air to move becauseair is required so also moist so also the
what you call it will be helpful for the micro-organismto take that And sun light will not enter
into the mulch and heat also it will be notaffecting If it is too much of heat it will
affect the micro-organisms Because the airis there air will act as an insulating you
know material so heat will not get into thatmuch right and it will be helpful for the
take some soil mixing it also right
And Straw mulching which is commonly usedyou know straw the hay that we use and which
is you know that can be used for the mulchingyou might have seen if you could have managed
to go to the field Even today some portionof the our country they are still leaving
them straw there in the field you know thatis required for mulching
And Live mulching is basically by the treesitself As I told it is similar to the Inter-cropping
or the Mixed cropping you do have so thatthey would complement each other and the shadow
of one will be other so that it will be helpfulfor the soil to be remain intact not affected
by the heat or not affected by the other thingsright So that is also known also Live mulching
So mulching if you look at this is the picturewhat I would like to show it is basically
straw mulching here the these are the strawright and these are the straw which used for
mulching okay and these are the plants arecoming so that the weeds will not be allowed
to grow in this you know because of the mulchingis there and then it will cover and it will
help also the earthworm and other insectswhich are friends of the soil to grow very
easily and also they will come they will bedoing their activity
So if we look at we do apply farm you knowmulching because of decreasing water loss
due to evaporation if the mulching cover isnot there lot of water will be evaporated
right it will be acting as a barrier for theevaporation And people says one KG of mulching
absorbs around four litres of water due todew rain and irrigation in the night time
you know some of the dew can form there becausethere is a surface So then you know it will
again become wet so you know you need notto give water that much and even during rainy
season or the irrigation when you put somewater kind of things it will be remain in
the things It will not get evaporated
So reducing the weed growth by reducing theamount of light reaching the soil the light
the sun light will not be entering into Thereforethat other plant will not really germinate
nearby
And preventing soil erosion you know soilerosion is a big problem because of due to
use of these tractors and having a very highdepth tillage they are using a tiller So that
that is making a deep and then the soil erosionand more soils are coming and then erosion
happening and whereas if we use our traditionalplough which is having a very small angle
of depth so that the this will be reducingthe erosion So also mulching if you do again
soil erosion will be reducing drasticallyincreasing the number of micro-organism in
the top soil because it helps in developingmicro-organism which is important for the
growth of the plants because it acts as atheir dead bodies and other things act as
a organic matter it will be helpful for thefor the growth of the plant
And adding nutrients to soil and improvingsoil structure I have told you that this micro-organism
and organic matter will help and how to usethe mulch Mulch basically can be applied to
a warm or a wet soil that is important itshould not be applied for the dry soil when
the soil is dry you should not put becauseit will not help and as already died it will
remain dry right
And the care should be taken to the thicknessof mulch applied And too thick mulch will
prevent the air flow and encourage the pestto grow right So beside these this generally
10 centimetre being you know recommended forthe 10 centimetre thick of mulching is recommended
for germination of plants and seeds but someplaces you may go for 10 particularly when
you will get the land which is persistencewith weed wheat right So we may use that depending
on that but is not a very what you call fixednumber it should use as a guideline that is
all So with this I will stopover we will bediscussing more about you know manures and
other things in the next lecture thank youvery much
