Let us start this lecture with thought processthat all of you here are to learn right learning
is a process and we should have love for learningSo I always feel that love for learning lessens
the labor pains of learning Today learningis a very difficult process for all of you
right Because you people are occupied withseveral other things and therefore it is very
important that you should develop love forit and learning is a part and parcel of human
life
Let us recall what we learnt in the last lectureWe basically looked at that why we need to
go for agriculture as a basis for our growthright and why because you know like we are
having naturally endowed with the resourceswhich are very conducive and you know for
the agriculture or for the farm and lateron we looked at that like what are the processes
involved in agriculture and how this modernagriculture being implemented as of now right
And today we will be looking at what are theproblems we are facing with the modern farming
and you know like in nineteen uhh Fiftiesor the sixties you know like we are having
green revolution People are very much wheregaga about it and today also some of the you
know intellectuals are very saying that weneed to go for second green revolution Is
it really revolution or not that we will seeand I will I will put forward or I will show
you uhh Some data to it but let us beforethat let us look at what are the problem in
them modern agriculture
We use more fertilizers and more pesticidesFor what Because more fertilizers will give
the growth will be better and then you knowproduction of the crop will be high and more
pesticide we will have to give because thepest or the are more increasing at a number
because as a result that we are more profitmaniac like you know we are want to have more
greedy greed greediness has come to our mindtoo much right and there is a whole world
not only in India and across because of thisis what you call mentalism like I told earlier
market mentalism makes the man maniac
So we became maniac know like profit and forgrabbing all those things are going on in
our mind that is a dead what you call uhhdeterioration of mind power to think which
is right which is wrong getting swayed awayTherefore that is the problem and then it
is trust upon us and we are just not thinkingabout it Then pest and diseases are part and
parcel of nature Keep in mind that becauseone person will be relying on other Right
and they balance and so also disease is thething to decay and you will be going This
is the part of nature
In ideal system natural balance between predatorsand pests are to be maintained so you know
each are connected with each other These areall philosophy what our embedded in our you
know uhh Traditional knowledge system in ourancient is done and which we need to understand
basic things what we are talking about hereyou need to understand the basic laws of nature
and then work accordingly and not going againstand you know unbalancing or doing something
that balance will be broken
Balance is important because we cannot reallylook at and only small micro management The
whole big picture we need to look at it andbig picture are very order and then it may
be looking like a disorder but actually asI told that our civilization in order in disorder
and that is natural So that has to be lookedat So chemical control that is why we want
to have a control over this uhh diseases andalso the pests so that last 40 years you know
insecticides use has been increased tenfoldWhile the crop losses from the pest damage
have doubled
Loses are increasing and you are increasingthat also like insecticides so one has to
look at that why it is so and as a resultthe safety of the people One million cases
of poisoning by pesticide each year aroundthe world and up to Twenty thousand of these
results in debt this poisoning because ofthis number may be more I mean like you know
and dates occur in tropical countries wherechemical pesticides which are banned in Europe
and other Western countries like USA or steelbeing used in India
Right uhh I mean there are several examplesI am not going to look at it and you can see
your≈Ø For example DDT and some other thingwhen you are people are not use but we are
using here in this country So and cost ofthe farming increasing at alarming rate and
as a result food prices are also being increasedvery much around 300% in the last 10 years
and if you look at we are having people whoare hands to mouth meaning like hands to mouth
laborers and where they will get the foodBecause the food price are now are comparable
to the globally global market and earlierdays food was very cheaper in this country
Whenever I visit other country I feel oh weare safe we are having at least food A common
person can get Today it is not because ofglobalization and you know uhh and problem
with the industrial agricultural practicehere I have already discussed let me just
highlight some of the points since I willbe highlighting more again because I want
that some of the things will be repeated naturebut keep in mind these are important
We need to understand that then only we cantake correct step As I told that mono cultures
basically the single kind of crop they useand that erodes the bio diversity among both
plants and animals It is not only with theplants only because all are connected So therefore
that is creating and uhh if you look at thenature is always multi-layer or various things
you know it is not a heterogeneous it is nothomogeneous
We are trying to make it homogeneous becausein engineering we do that you know but that
is not ha! That is a wrong it is not a easierto handle the heterogeneous thing you make
it homogenous therefore you say that no natureis other way around It is your limitation
that you are trying to push forward or thetrust upon the people but you must understand
that nature is not like that And there isa strength in that synthetic chemical fertilizers
are being used blatantly which pollute thesoil not only the soil water and air and whatever
the environment we are getting spoilt becauseof the blatant use of chemical fertilizers
I will be showing how it is so and both environmentand although not only the human health but
also the animal health plant health If allare being connected so soil which is the soul
of infinite lives right and that is gettingspoilt you know much faster than it can be
replenished And taking with its lands fertilitywhatever the fertility nutrients the land
the soil is having it is going away and whicheverimportant this fertility and nutrients are
very important for the growth of the plantsand those things we eat as a food But those
are being getting away you know
I will be showing you later on like what arethe things and I will also give data how this
most of the civilization got extinguishedgot spoilt because of soil quality is going
down at that time We need to keep that maybein the next class I will show you some data
And water is consumed at an unsustainablerate it is in many agricultural areas because
water is being used too much and it is alsohelping to take away or leaching out the what
you call this fertility and nutrients whichyou are adding to the soil artificially and
also the natural one All are going away soyou know you are using because of too much
use of water
So effect of pesticides on an environmentif you look at chemical pesticide can kill
useful insects There are a lot of microorganismsinsects are very useful Pollination for pollination
you need but they are not you know And forif pollination will not be there you cannot
have a food production You may have very bigplants but you do not have and nowadays in
western countries people are using artificialpollination You know like why you will do
that and cost will be increasing which ledthe pest leading to the unbalancing nature
and the whole mother nature in imbalanced
You are cutting the limbs; fingers of theyou know if you look at the body my fingers
have been cut My you know hand being removedfrom the mother nature you know mother nature
if you consider as a body That is not theway So therefore you need to look at it and
as I told earlier artificial chemical canstay in an environment in the bodies for a
number of years Right even if you want touse it will stay for you in the earthling
for generation to generation and you cannotreally afford to do that and causing problems
for many years It is not for your generationit is for the next maybe five ten generation
will have to suffer because of you have usedthe chemical fertilizers and which are not
good for the health
So therefore we need to understand insectpest are very quickly or over a period of
breeding cycle they become resistant to artificialproducts They also try to resist the things
and develop hormones and other thing for thatthey can Because that is the nature nature
is intelligent you know They are working togrow If somebody will try to hit you you will
have to protect yourself right Find out whois on means Use your mind use your body use
your resources use your power to do that Theyare also doing that way Ok and are no longer
controlled by the label of chemicals whatyou were using earlier days
I will be showing you some data as well Soif you look at fertilizer consumptions you
look at this In 1960 we are having fertilizerconsumption and is very very low If you look
at this is the color orange color The lineis very very low million tons Very you know
like one or two million tons and it is goeson increasing And so also China and then we
are because we want to grow at a faster ratethan the other people and that is the bigger
problem But If you look at America which isvery intelligent people you know like they
have grown this higher increase from 1960to maybe 80 there is realized that this is
not good and they are all must remaining constantand sometimes going negative and I do not
know the data last maybe six seven years butI am sure that they might have decreased it
So if you look at we need to do that We willhave to cut off and then the whole business
you know they are sending their multinationalcompanies to here to use us and spoil Who
will be intelligent you know we have to understandthis and do that So and if you look at we
are as we are using more fertilizers and morepesticides and other things we are spoiling
also the ground water I was told of coursethis may not be the correct but you please
check and do not go by any data I am givingPlease correct check it and then accept it
In some newspaper this thing I learnt that60% of ground water in China are not drinkable
In India you think about it My guess is aroundmaybe 20 to 25% and at least in Kanpur I know
there is a some area where the water has goneground water has gone bad deadly bad So therefore
we need to and worry about that because thatsustain the life and if we spoil the ground
water and which are inter connected how weare going to what you call correct it or how
we are going to replenish how you will dothat Can you take it out the pump and again
put it Is it possible all are connected youknow like interconnected Right so how you
will you know take care of that polluted waterso therefore we will have to be worry about
And if you look at the fertilizer consumptionand nitrogen there is a phosphatic type potassic
type These are all increasing you know in1991 we are something 80 in lakhs tons you
know This is in lakhs of tons 80 lakhs tonsand in 2007 166 and today maybe it will be
something 175 or maybe 80 I do not know Okyou please look at it They all are increasing
We should decrease it or it at least stabilizeit you know because we know it is they are
harmful but still because our people are illiterateand so also the thing and the people are using
advertisement and other thing to what youcall leave them for this for more production
and more profit as a tool to imbibe them orleave them all our we are spoiling the health
Let us look at how is the food productionrelated to fertilizer consumptions Right So
if you look at this is I have taken the datafrom 72 to 2002 is the little old data but
let us look at the trend This blue color fertilizerconsumption rate it is going up sometimes
it in 75 it is gone up above the red linethat is corresponding to the million tons
of the food production And then if we lookat it is food production is lower down at
least 95 onwards and the fertilizer consumptionis increasing and let me tell you last year
I had gone to some nearby village in Kanpurwhere people are you know and then I enquired
with the farmers and I told them what arethe consumption
They are saying that we are using almost doublethe fertilizers what we are using 10 years
back for getting the same you know tonnagefor acre kind of a crop Look at what we are
doing that means the soil fertility has beengone down and you are adding more and more
and then it will be spoiling Right so thereforethe farmer is committing suicide because the
cost of farming is increasing at an alarmingrate than the what price they can get in the
in the you know what to call market
As a result you know they are in debt Thereforegovernment of India is you know what you call
taking away the debt in the sense giving thewhat you call subsidy not subsidies it is
cancel like waving of loans waving of loansTheir waving of the loans but that is not
the solutions Solution has to be found outlooking at what are the causes of it and then
look at fundamentally and solve the problemand there all of you who are listening to
this lectures and then you will have to comeinto picture and educate them and also educate
the government about this wrong policies ofusing this concepts because we are democracy
we should do that
And the growth is and we are all talking aboutgreen revolutions and other things and we
want to have a another green revolution Peopleare talking about genetically modified crops
and I am afraid one should not venture tothat Of course there are several reason I
will not be talking about why you need tobut you will have to if you are interested
get into that and find it out yourself Sothe growth rate of the crop production let
us look at What happened in our uhh the greenrevolution Let us look at that this 1234567
in this diagram for the wheat We are talkingabout pre green revolution something 1951
to 1968 we are having something 37 you knowis the tons of this So eh≈Ø this I have taken
the data from the draft of twelve plan documentdaily planning commission in 2013
Right so let us say this is the percentageyou know what you are having then it has been
decreased in the green revolution period 69to 81 Ok and then again it is little bit increase
up and going down and then down and this thingagain people are increasing because of in
the seventh plan And that is true with ifyou look at this point for the rice for the
wheat and then for pulses for oil seeds Ofcourse oil seed has little bit gone up I mean
corresponding to this 1951 and uhh and intoday kind today means eleven twelve But wheat
and rice and pulses you know it is lower thanthat what it was there previous thing
So therefore you can judge from yourself andthis data I have taken from this thing that
look this is a myth that we are having a greenrevolution Ok because the crop we are putting
lot of pesticide lot of fertilizer and butthis thing we are not growing I mean like
we are like various fluctuations dependingupon your what you call your climate and it
is depending upon other parameters you knowthat is there
So one has to look at data and analyze itand then only we can say that look there is
a green Beside this we are paying price forthe what for the use of this chemicals fertilizer
pesticides spoiling soil air and that thingWe will be talking about the problems of chemical
fertilizer Let us understand that and thereis a micro nutrient imbalance because of utilizing
the chemical fertilizers Because we know thatchemical fertilizers contain nitrogen phosphorus
potassium which are micro nutrient
These are the micro nutrients you know youcan think of and excess use of fertilizers
during the farming causes micro nutrient imbalancebecause the soil you are giving artificially
For giving artificially you know soil willbe imbalance Maybe you are adding more than
what is required So excess of anything isbad Right you need to know that what are the
things And they will be also imbalance becauseof root we will be taking and then it will
be not taking all the things It will be remaining
I will be talking about later on about likeroot how they take and what will be the size
of roots if we use chemical fertilizer ifwe use natural farming All those things I
will be talking about little bit later onparticularly when I will be going to the natural
farming Excess is the affect the soil fertilityadversely and also the productivity as I told
just now that the with my own experience wewere talking with the farmers in the nearby
Kanpur area They are saying they are usinglarge number of you know large amount of fertilizer
for the same amount of crop production inthe same land
Right over the years and that is true youcan see and you can ask anybody and you are
also having data nowadays internet you canget the data and maybe from reliable source
because internet one has to be careful aboutdata You can go to the government sources
some other things you can find it out Whatare the consumptions you know I have shown
you earlier So there is a nitrate pollutionlike excess nitrogen nitrogenous fertilizer
leach deep into the soil because you are usinglot of water also
Irrigation you know like and there is a groundwater you are using the pump you know the
power Right electricity and the diesel andlift irrigation system now has come up You
press the button and the water will be spreadthis thing And it is sometimes I have seen
at least in the nearby Kanpur area that isthey use lot of water unnecessarily and that
can contaminate the ground water also Andthat is happening in lot of areas and other
water body is nearby is getting spoilt
You know nitroces fertilizer and if the concentrationof nitrate in the drinking water exceeds 25
milligram per liters it affects motility rateand the low weight of the new born babies
which is basically these are you know lowweight and a thing known as a blue baby syndromes
Right and which is showing and I will showdiagram maybe next slides that and blue baby
syndrome refers to at least two situationsone is Cyanotic heart means you know there
will be arteries which will be thicker andthinner that problem will be there and this
methemoglobinemia that means like a anemiayou know like blood will be less and now it
will be little bit different than that thiscauses problem in the blood itself
So you can look at this term I am not sureabout that but you look at that So what is
that I mean this is causing problem whichwill be with the baby itself Then you know
where you will go Right so these are veryserious problem of the blue baby syndromes
and there is another problem which comes eutrophicationEutrophication basically when you use excess
fertilizer that can pass to the nearby waterbodies Ok and as a result there will be over
nourishments in this pond water bodies andwhich is known as eutrophication
Because the over nourishment if over nourishmentwill be there then what will happen that the
algae you know there will be lot of growthin algae at faster rate And then they will
grow very rapidly Right then again they willdie And as a result because their life is
short and they die and pollute the water affectingthe aquatic life adversely That you might
have seen that in your you know observationif you are having good observation See the
cause is this one so therefore this causesand that is the problem
If you look at this pesticide there are twokinds of pesticide people use Fast generation
pesticide use Sulphur arsenic lead and mercuryto kill pests Look at this these are all dangerous
one should not add it but we are using Thesecond generation is of course the DDT the
Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane which isused to kill pests and these pesticides are
organic nature Of course but pesticide protectsour crop from severe loss due to pests but
they have several side effects you know canthink of they have several side effects
They should not be used as such and side effectsof pesticides as I told that basically they
are non-target organisms Suppose you wantto kill X but now you will be killing Y Z
and other things and which are beneficialSo several insecticide kill not only the target
pests but also the several beneficial andorganism which are not of target And as I
told that after you know you use this pestsseveral times the people those are also living
organisms They try to resist and certain pestsand of course certain things may not resist
properly but certain pests that could manageto survive became highly resistance to all
kinds of pesticides
You know these pests are called as super pestslike superman you know they became super pests
So and bio magnifications is another thingmost pesticide are non-biodegradable Right
it cannot be degraded by the soil or otherthings So get into food chain which is known
as bio accumulation It will be getting accumulatedand these pesticides in bio accumulation form
are harmful to the human being and as I toldit will remain for your body chain you know
chain food chain for several time also inyour own body Right and it will be transmitted
you know various pumps
And surface and ground water pollution youknow like toxicity to aquatic wild life and
human through drinking water Right all thosethings Risk of cancers like pesticides enhances
the risk of getting cancers in two ways Itacts as a carcinogen also and it indirectly
spoil the human system You might be awarethat there is a train known as cancer train
which is originated from Punjab You are awareall of you In the train all cancer patient
will be coming you know That is why peoplecall it cancer train because in Punjab Haryana
region they are using this pesticides andfertilizers to a larger extent
They can say like the rice wheat bowl or thefood bowl of India but they are really spoiling
their own health and giving us food and thatis also not good quality So I will stop over
here and we will be looking at the what youcall disadvantages of the or the use in this
modern farming I the next lecture and lateron I will tell about like what is the quality
of food we are using and then we will be lookingat basically why we need to go for the ancient
technology for the agriculture
Thank you very much
