Let us start this lecture 5 uhh with a thoughtprocess from (get) great scientist Albert
Einstein I like him very much because he talksomething which touches my heart The concern
for man and his destiny must always be thechief interest of all technical effort That
we are not doing today We are doing technologyor the other thing for the market Never forget
it among your diagrams and equations
We do that We use lot of diagrams equationsbut what for those things Those are for the
human welfare That is a very important pointI must tell you to you people So let us recall
that what we learnt And we learnt a lot fromthe Kautilya the what you call he is also
known as Chanakya the great person India hasproduced a great teacher That naven anvam
shodhyet that means we will have to do researchand relook at the old stuff and use it modern
time
And then we look at chronological order whateverthis little amount of scriptures we could
manage to keep in spite of number of invasionsright And thousand years of being subjugation
by the powers which were there in this countryAnd we find plethora of informations and knowledge
our ancestors were having
But I will now just to complete that uhh takingfrom what you call 900 to 1200 AD If you look
at this is Ganitasarasamgraha of Mahaviraand uhh Rasahridaya of Govinda Bhatta Krishiparasara
ofÖand also the Vrksayurveda If you lookat these are the scriptures what we are having
These are the things whatever theyÖyou knowlike lot of things are not there And this
is the Rasahrdaya and of Govinda Bhatta Andthe Krishiparasara it is about agriculture
This is Vrksayurveda about how to take careof plants and other things And during this
period there is a manuals people have donefor agriculture like and botany And of course
uhh like a use of mineral medicines and thereis a (encyp) like encyclopedic work is there
And uhh there is a lot of things have comeinto pictures what we are getting like a summation
of series and Sridhara method of solving quadraticequation
I mean the quadratic equation we know thehow to solve We use it in schools and colleges
but there is various ways given by SridharaAnd you might be aware iron pillar at Dhar
And lot of alchemical ideas were being usedat that time And we are having iron-casting
paper making and several other things likeuhh there is a book of Manasollasa of Somadeva
right This book
And in from 1300 to 1500 this is uhh SarangadharaSamhita there is a one book which we are having
We talk about Materia medica and also theurine and pulse examination of the body they
were doing it It is not that today we areonly doing the examination they do that earlier
days And ëNew dimension to astronomical andmathematical workí there is a book Lot of
chemistry books haveÖwe we got it I meanlike Rasaratnakar Rasasamuchaya like these
are the books what I am trying to tell
And there is a pyrotechnic you know like methodof doing that it isÖcame up and we are having
evidence Beside this we are having Keralaschool of mathematics And as I told like uhh
KeralaÖfrom Kerala it went to the westerncountries lot of mathematics tool and they
started looking at seriously And complex chemicalprocesses as we are telling pyrotechnics and
other things were also came up at that timewhat historian admitted they are saying it
So 1600 and 1700 like of course uhh thereis a lot of factories being established because
if you look at there it is the Mogul and theBritishersí you know period kind of things
And industry and other thing dwelling Basicallycottage industry was in you know uhh what
you call were there earlier because we alwayshave a cottage industries if you look at our
history But these are the big industries littlemedium level come up
And then the our things also got this thingdestroyed in the process And uhh of course
the gun and gun powders came into pictureslike we are having lot of uhh cannons And
astronomical ideas of course crafts stillwe are doing that thing Like agriculture perfumery;
you know perfumes were being used by the Mogulor the Muslim rulers and we are having it
Perfumes were also earlier there but theywere using for that and therefore lot of you
know this thing
1800 AD onwards we are having alsoÖstillthis you know knowledge generation was continuing
In spite of invasion it was going on And unfortunatelythis 1800 to 2000 that several you know technologies
we have taken from the outside country atthe cost of indigenous technologies So our
own people are become jobless And even inspite of apathy for them still you will go
to the rural area you go to even Kanpur cityyou will find some you know uhh kumbhar jo
kahate hai potters
You will be finding some blacksmiths and thenthey are doing a wonderful work in spite of
all this thing And according to me India havinga populous country it should not go for the
uhh what you call mass producing and alsothe machines such that you know our people
will be jobless We should go for the whatyou call the cottage industry so that more
employment can be generated and uhh also thecreativity can be developed
Let me tell you what I think I think is thatthis is the Patent Raj; patent is killing
the creativity and also the market forcesare taking And then it should be people should
have knowledge not the market forces Earlierdays our country were always believe people
should have knowledge scientific knowledgetechnological knowledge they can involve in
creativity and enjoy the life So that we needto revive
I must urge all of you do not go after thejob create the job for others and develop
a eco-friendly technologies so that more peoplecan be employed and more people can be creative
and enjoy their life So therefore we needto look at what we need and this ancient science
and technology can give us way to do that
And let me now look to littleÖthis is aboutchronological right What I am now trying to
tell you like little more details about thatAnd we will go back to the Harrapan civilizations
And that geographical setting if you lookat it is the north side the Himalayan regions
right If you look at like these areÖwhichis not shown here but these are the Himalayan
region here it will be
And eastern basically passable low hill Andthis is basicallyÖin this region this is
the Harappan culture we are having This isyou call it Kabul and this is your Indus River
And this is Jhelum River and the Chenab Raviand Sutlej all are joining to this And the
nearby this you know like earlier days theSarasvati river was there people are saying
And this is your Mohenjo-daro which is thespot and uhh as I told you that Mehrgarh is
the place here where which is the one of theHarappan sites
And uhh Kalibangan region also is one of theHarappaís And Lothal let me look at it where
it is Lothal here this is also Harappan sitesThese areÖif you look at whole regions are
basically Harappan region this region whatyou call you know This is the region what
people have accepted Okay And so uhh one sideisÖwest side is your Arabian Sea And this
is yourÖin the northwest side this side basicallyyou will be having the passable Hindu Kush
Parvat you know like mountain will be thereand Khyber Pass
And uhh of course north side the Plain ofIndus This is Ganges Rivers; if you look at
this is your Yamuna and this are the Gangariver here Okay And these are the Gangetic
Plains regions This region is the GangeticPlain regions And uhh and this is of course
this this region is the your Deccan regionsouthern side and high plateau extremely dry
these regions and the border on the east andwest by mountains
As I told you there will be Eastern Ghatshere in this region Eastern Ghats and this
is Western Ghats separated from the northby river low mountains of course we are having
And if you look at that is very importantbecause this sea is you know controls your
monsoon wind and so also the Himalayan Theseare the things what govern And we are destroying
this Eastern Ghat and Western Ghats and othermountains as well right We are spoiling it
And we do not know what we are doing So howto overcome because people want to have a
what you call buildings or the rooms whichis made out of concrete Now from where they
will get stone From the mountains If you lookat 130 crore people if everybody will having
a house which is made of concrete then wherewill be mountains And that life of a concrete
house is 50 years Then after that what willbe Again whereÖafter the mountains you destroyed
then where we will go
So mountain has to be protected How to goabout it Is there any technology we can have
a good house pakka house right Not out ofmud and also do that How to do that Can you
get any technology from the ancient time Iwill show you that later on that we can do
that
So of the what you call uhh October to Aprilis the dry season generally But nowadays it
is changing It isÖso also the of the IndianOcean maybe in (())(11:39) wet wet seasons
right May to September There is a lot of rainkind of things and this is helps I I will
tell you that we areÖwe should take careof ecology And then that is the geographical
kind of thing
So if you look at as I told that this is theKhyber uhh or you call it Khyber Pass or this
is a Hindu Kush you know mountain range Andthis is your Harappan site Indus what you
call river it goes And these are the sitesI have told already right So uhh this Indus
Valley regions were having rich deposit butuhh of course it was like a Nile they always
compare with the Nile river right
And and wheat and barley were cultivated inthe Indus Valley what people are already found
out and then cultivated cotton before 3000BC right And uhh if you look at this Harappa
and Mohenjo-daro like if you look at yourHarappa is here in this city one and Mohenjo-daro
in this region right That is the place Andpossibly they might have served as a twin
capitals like the today we are having youknow twin capitals
So umm and each (chity) each city had a fortifiedcitadel That means where the administration
administrative people will be there it willbe also protected And uhh a large granary
that means lot of food stuff they will bestoring in that And those streets I will be
showing something later on I am just tellingnow the broad streets and market places temples
and public buildings were there like whateverwe are having in modern time and that is something
uhh 6000 BC according to the new data otherwise3000 BC Okay
So uhh they were having standardized weightsmeasures and arch kind of things which I will
not be talking but it is there And they werehaving very good at architecture they were
using burned bricks as well So uhh domestictrades like they were having Like items like
pottery tools metals like and also they wereusing lot of other items like cottons
And they were trading with Mesopotamians Greekand other things from something 2300 to 1750
BC If you look at these are the products whatthey were having like this is the thing what
you do best right Even today also we are doingthis flower vase And these are basically weight
you can see this one right And uhh and theseare of course dolls and then kind of things
and various motifs are being used like
So of course there is a various phases peoplehave divided They call it basically uhh Ravi
phase or Early Harappan phase Kot Diji phaseKot Diji is theÖis not shown in this diagram
it will be somewhere unknown place And HarappanPhase A Harappa Phase B Harappa Phase C depending
upon this chronological you know years AndHarappa/Late Harappan Transitional and then
Late Harappan is something 1800 BC to 1300BC Of course these numbers also will be varying
from different you know uhh group of people
So if you look atÖLet us look at Indus ValleyCivilizations And as I told there were having
a lot of you know engineering components Andthey were following the decimal divisions
of measurements for all practical purposesthat what we use And including the measurement
of mass they were also knowing how to measurethe mass that like we use Kg Gram and other
things
And if you look at they were having the IndusValley utensils You can see it is so nice
looking and then they could have and so alsothe dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro If you look
at this kind of uhh things are being usedby the Gujarati people even today these are
bangles okay These bangles are still todayThat means from that onwards we are having
the tradition That means our culture is livingSo this isÖthere are several signature you
will get you will have to look at it Lookat with that eye
So these are also the what you call they wereusing lot of ornaments for their to the you
knowÖthese are the very fine minute ornamentsHow they were making What are the technology
they were having Today if I want to make Iwill have to use sophisticated machine Do
they had sophisticated machines How they weremaking those things Right They may be having
we do not know But if you think of you knowit is very difficult
And this if I ask all of you engineering peoplelike if I will ask how to make this thing
very few people will tell me ìLook! You canmake this wayî Okay So these are the thing
we need to say ìHow they were making Whatare the precision How they are doingî
Like red pottery you know like if you havevery good motif it is having design How they
are doing And still existing after so manyÖtheseare all evidence from that excavation It is
not that some picture has been made lateron So very interestingly if you look at a
paper published in ëNatureí which is a veryprestigious journal rightÖ And a best or
the most prestigious journal is Nature Theypublished in 2006 and about the how people
were doing this in vivo In a living personthey were doing the drilling the human teeth
Today also we do if you are old or somethingyour teeth has gone bad; they were doing at
that time And that has been proved And 11drilled molar crowns from the nine adults
were discovered in the Neolithic graveyardin Mehrgarh I talked about Mehrgarh where
it is is a city place that dates from some3500 to 5000 years ago
Again they are saying this what they havedated Of course IIT Kharagpur is saying 1000
years again more than this But according toauthor their discoveries point to the tradition
of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultureof that region Because our culture if you
look at it is farming agriculture I rememberwhen Gyani Zail Singh he was a president he
told in foreign country: What is your cultureHe told spontaneously agriculture I used to
laugh at him but today I realize he was true
Agriculture is the culture of our countryThe village is the soul of our country We
should keep the village culture intact andso also the urban It is not that only village
will be there We always live in a urban andvillage kind of thing both are important So
therefore we need to learn these things: howthey were manufacturing And I am sure that
they were not using that machine of what weare using They were using the cottage industry
ñ by using the mind and you know hand ñthis balance between mind and hand So that
we are having it is there in our blood Weneed to revive
So if you look at there is a lot of this thingwhich I have already talked I will not talk
about that But I will tell you that one thingñ The Harappan society was free from manmade
destructions Today we do that If you lookat newspaper lot of destruction we are doing
We are not at peace The society is not atpeace because of blatant misuse abuse of the
technologies
So and no evidence of warfare invasions andof course why it was collapsed is a one question
that might be arising in your mind Maybe itis due to some kind of climatic change or
maybe they had used the technology at thattime blatantly and spoiled their world therefore
it got extinct There are several questionslooming around and you people may do research
to find out why that civilization got extinctat that time till you know and then again
new phase started later on around 500 BC
Now I will come to the Vedic era So you mustbe knowing that Veda Veda is divided into
four types You know one is Rig Veda YajurVeda Sama Veda Atharva Veda So uhh it is text
are available today it is very difficult toread
You want to read you will have to learn Ashtadhyayithat grammar I am afraid very few people are
(agr) are there in this country who can teachyou you know properly And we need to revive
that; otherwise you cannot understand theVedas
And the basic text is four Vedas as I toldAnd each Vedas uhh will be having Samhita
Brahmanas Aranyaka and Upanishads These areall various parts which need to be look at
it Of course I do not know uhhÖI could notunderstand I was trying to read Vedas but
I will tell you I like Upanishads which isvery easier and simpler and very profound
in that And one should study that; of coursewith the help of somebody one can look at
Vedas
And there are uhh supplemental text 6 Vedangasand complimentary text 4 Upavedas Upangas
which are still existing There might be severalother things Main ancient knowledge system
is basically 14 disciplines So if you lookat this is basically 6 and 4 10 and then this
4 total is 14 as of now So supplementary textif you look at it will be Shiksha Shiksha
means education and also the phonetics Phoneticsvery plays important today we do not know
phonetics
We do not know the science because ours isa phonetics based language but we do not know
how it is and that is being emphasized earlierdays And of course education what was given
I will not talk here it will take at least2-3 hours to talk about that What is a kind
of education I have understood little bitabout it And Vyakaran is very profound very
great and people have accepted it We do notread that way And prosody that is the Chandas
basically How to do that It is an art It alsorequire a lot of mind We do not do that today
Nirukta etymologies like how these words haveformed we do not know If I ask somebody how
this word has comeÖ Let us say ëmanavímanav kisko kahoge Man what you call ìOh
no no Manav is manî It is not You are havingsome definition certain things properly it
is being spelled out science is there It isa very beautiful we do not do that Jyotisha
is being looked down upon today because ofbusiness because of misuse of it And Kalp
rules of rituals ñ whatever the rituals thereshould be some rules and it is having certain
reason Those are we do not know It has tobe looked at research has to be done
So if you look at those uhh Upavedas of coursethey are divided into four parts One is Ayurveda
most of you will be aware because it is comingup again And unfortunately Ayurveda is being
practiced in the form of allopathy Peoplehave not understood They should use through
the tenets of that and then practice thatway
I will not elaborate on that And I will justinform you that these are the things one can
look at: Dhanurvedas Gandharva Vedas and ArthaVedas that is about economy And all those
things together if you look at Artha Vedaeconomy you can think of Shilpa Samhita I
have already talked about lately what do youmean by shilpa in the first lecture
So what I will do basically you can say ShilpaSamhita is basically engineering or technology
treatise kind of things It will be about Dhatukhandabout Earth science about what are the things
are there Sadhankhand is basically about transportationslike sea transportation and then what you
call uhh road transportation Of course peopleare claiming that there is air transportation
but I do not know that But at least sea andthe naval ship and then other thing we can
accept Okay Architecture the Vastukhand thereis aÖwe are having Vastushastra it is now
a very big business People are making a lotof you knowÖthey are fooling the people also
one has to be careful
And then when you talk about this Earth scienceis basically agriculture because agriculture
was very part and part of our civilizationeven today ñ till today although we lost
the way to western people Now again the agricultureis coming up with a new name of organic farming
but that is our way of doing it And we mustrelearn it not from the western people from
our scriptures and improvise it if it is requiredat this moment Jalshastra water is very important
And mining the khanishastra is also is onecan look at it
And if you look at krishishastra is basicallyvrukshavidya like plantations pashuvidya about
animal science manushyavidya like human resourcesyou know like is a part of krishi you know
like it is a part of krishi So how to makethem this thing Jalshastra will be about scriptures
of water Sansechanvidya they basically irrigationand sangranvidya drainage of water like how
to uhh transport and other things
And stambhanvidya storage of water becausewater storing is very important and is a natural
way people have done I will be talking aboutthat when I will talk about water harvesting
how natural it was to us And if you look atthe khanishastra is pruthakaran separation
of metal that we do in modern time and bhasmikaranvidya calcination I will be talking about
that later on
And sankarvidya making of alloys we are havingYou might be knowing most of the temples we
are having any metal it will be panchdhatuashtadhatu navdhatu you know these are all
nothing but alloys And dhrutividya gemologylike you know gems Like we areÖvery good
people are using lot of things earlier theywere knowing how to do that
And transportation if you look at naukashastralike boats making; rathashastra horse riding;
agniyanshastra people call it space travelI do not know about that but at least I can
say that naukashastra we are having evidenceRathashastra anyway we are there So these
are the things has to be looked at it Butwhen I say I do not know that does not mean
we will not look at it We will look at witha pinch of salt with a you know mind to unravel
prove that it is right not go by emotion goby the something
Toh tarividya raft makings; nauvidya constructionof boats; naukavidya construction of ships
right All were having And uhh rathashastraof course so these are theÖuktikalpataru
Arthashastra these are the (skip) scripturesavailable and uhh Rathalakshanam Shukraniti
Arthashastra right These are the things fromwhere you will get some information about
this
Ashvavidya horse riding; pathavidya road construction;ghantapathvidya hill roads like roads will
be hill side one; Setuvidya bridge constructionUhh so if you look at agniyanshastra what
people are giving Yantra Sarvasva AgastyaSamhita Samarangana Sutradhara these are the
books whatever people have collected And shakuntavidyabirds training they were doing earlier days
to train the bird to give the informationVimanvidya air and spacecraft
So uhh about the what you call architectureabout building fort making and town planning:
I will be talking about town planning andalso about the rural areas how we can make
buildings kind of things I will be talkingabout theÖof course I will not be touching
upon fort making because from these two wecan learn a lot how we can do
And uhh I think this veshmashastra if youlook at how to uhh look at vasovidya tents
People were making tents and huts kutividyaMandirvidya I will be talking about how to
make the huts what people are using; MandirvidyaI may not Prasadvidya like palaces And uhh
nagar-rachna shastra town planning I willbe talking about Aapanvidya market; rajgruh
vidya; sarvajanvaas vidya public places; vanopavanvidya garden I will do and devalaya vidya
temples
So I will be talking about in town planningonly the buildings I will not be touching
upon temples is a very vast subject you knowSo and this fort making I will not talking
about the durgavidya forts; castle like kutvidya;aakarvidya like moats you people might be
knowing is basically drench which will behaving this thing; yuddhavidya warfare
So uhh what I will be now I will be stoppingover here And then we have seen what is the
plethora of knowledge our ancestors were havingbut we will be discussing some of them only
okay So uhh you have seen the whole gamutlike of the things whatever they required
for leading a very nice life and also a veryproductive and balanced life Some of the technology
are required And we will be looking as wego along with that
And in the next lecture I will be talkingabout how our people were doing science what
are the basic principles they were followingThat we will be looking at in the next lecture
Thank you very much
