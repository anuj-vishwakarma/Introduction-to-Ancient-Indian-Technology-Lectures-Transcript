Let us start this lecture about the MaterialTechnology and we will be discussing basically
about Metals and Metallurgy in ancient IndiaIf you recall that in the last 31 lectures
we have basically discussed about uhh glimpsesof ancient Indian science and technology later
on we moved to the agriculture and uhh thensubsequently to the housing and textile and
of course towards end we were discussing aboutwater management system in ancient India
And today we will be uhh discussing aboutmetal and about materials and let us look
at basically wonderful world of materialsAnd when you talk about materials uhh that
plays a very important role in not only inancient India and also in the present time
because we are now uhh having the materialismwhich is very predominant in our life But
if you look at the Indian Philosophy theyare always for the materials but not that
blatant materialism that is going on
So I will be trying to draw your attentionto the philosophy of Sankhya which was a very
uhh much talking about what you call Prakruthiand Purusha When you talk about Prakruthi
it is basically material And if you look atlike our way of life what is being talked
about in the Indian philosophy is Uhh basicallythe Dharma Artha Kama Moksha If you want to
realize the Artha and Kama then you need toplay with the materials and material plays
an important role When you talk about materialsbasically we need to understand what is the
basic science in it and also how to utilizethe understanding for developing certain technology
which will be achieving the uhh you know desireand also the Artha the material kind of things
such that are the needs such that you canachieve your the ultimate goal that is the
Moksha
So when you talk about this Prakruthi we area part of the nature the mother nature and
keeping mind that mother nature is a greatdesigner of all the materials what we see
and also the uhh you know various productsAnd modern science and technology try to uhh
what you call mimic them not in a very niceway but at least attempted to uhh you know
copy it and and also spoiling certain processand when you talk about this also we need
this medicine and materials are you know importantso far preparation of medicine uhh which is
required for a health of not only the humanbeings also the other living and nonliving
beings around the world So therefore we needto take care of the uhh mother nature as a
whole as we are s part of it So we need tolook at the uhh you know uhh metal and metallurgy
in that part
Let us look at the world of materials Andin ancient times the materials uhh being used
can be uhh classified into 4 categories Oneis Metal; the other is Ceramic Polymer and
Composite If you look at Metal the variouskinds of metals are being uhh were being used
in ancient India of course uhh we are alwaysuhh being fond of Gold and Silver apart from
Copper and also the Iron and beside this thereare alloys various kinds of alloys kind of
thing like your Bronze and then Brass andseveral other things
Ceramic of course was being used earlier daysin various forms like your if you look at
we talk about the potteries and then glassand several other things we use So ceramic
comes into polymer uhh were being used earlierbut most of them are derived from the what
you call biology or the uhh polymers wereuhh basically from the natural polymers or
polymer was a natural nature unlike in moderntime where we use unnatural polymers Now-a-days
people are talking about bio degradable polymerthat is why
But you combine all these kind of things togetheryou get may get another material which is
basically composite that means will be youknow various combination one can think of
like metal and ceramic you can think of compositesalso metallic ceramic and polymer various
permutation and combination you can In ancientIndia you may get some of the examples of
composite material For example like Uhh brickmaking in the brick itself we use the ceramic
like clay and besides this we will be usingsome kind of a saw dust and other things Even
I was told that uhh people were having thebow made of composite materials earlier times
which was a very light in weight and alsoaccurate in their flexibilities for this thing
And beside this for walls and for mortarsand other kind of ingredients you know composites
are being used
So if you look at although the today materialshave you know improved a lot and then it varieties
are there but earlier time most of the thingswere natural in nature or they were making
themselves although they are processing butthey were not Uhh designing them you know
Uhh what you call the way it has been donein modern time
So now a question might be coming to yourmind that does India have a strong metallurgical
background in ancient time Certainly yes wewill look at the background of it Uhh uhh
Look at historic chronological or how it wasdeveloped if you look at 100 million to 4000
BC there is a basically Pre-Harappan periodwhere people were using the Gold Copper possibly
may be uhh meteoric Iron kind of things Andof course the 3500 BC onwards like you know
Indus Valley Civilization where people wereusing uhh you know Silver Lead Arsenic Copper
and also of course uhh you know other maybe but also there alloys uhh being used for
their day to day affairs
Of course Indus Valley Civilization was agriculturalmostly but apart from that they have also
used some of these metals And it was alsobeen talked about they were knowing uhh the
Foundry you know technology Because of ifyou recall that I had shown you earlier a
dancing girl statue which was basically castingand more research has been going on today
also to find out how they were doing meansI was told that uhh the last was cast method
which is also known as investment castingwas also there in the during the Indus Valley
Civilization
And if you come to the Vedic Period whichis around 1500 – 2000 BCE apart from the
Silver Gold and other Coppers and other alloysthey were started using Iron profusely and
also the Steel and metal works were developedand beside this they were also using the Distillation
process And of course later on the 600 BCEonwards that is there is a Rise of Magadha
There is a various amalgamation of the metalswere being done and they also had developed
some soldering technique and Brass gildingsbecause they have started using also Brass
in number of ways
So if you go to the Buddhist Period somethingaround 500 BCE onwards and it was being mentioned
that Wootz Steel was developed at that timeMatter and Atomic Theory was also developed
during that time If you go to the MauryanDynasty particularly from Chandra Gupta Ashoka
and other things 321 – 184 BCE there isa method of uhh you know Cupellation they
had found out and beside this they had otherrefining technology Cupellation is a basically
refinery process of separating the preciousmetal like Gold Silver from the base metal
in which you know like ores or alloyed metalsare oxidized to a high temperature and a base
metals are separated by uhh absorption intothe walls of cupel We will be discussing a
little bit more about cupel cupellation lateron
And 600 – 700 CE uhh you will find a ofcourse the northern portion was invaded by
Huns and of course in southern portion Chalukyasand Chola empire was existing There is extensive
use of Iron Steel even Mercury Zinc apartfrom your Copper Gold Silvers and other things
Of course 1000 CE the northern was subjectedto Afgan’s raid and lot of things lost in
the process of course southern side was notaffected and lot of metal works were going
on in the southern side of the country
And 1100 CE Hoysala is a very big empire andthen you know like Brass and Bronze casting
was profusely used in the uhh southern partof the India apart from the uhh other usual
metal work And of course during Uhh 1300 – 1572CE uhh Mughal Sultanate was there in the northern
India and while the Vijaynagar empire wasin the southern part and both were using the
metals and metal crafts uhh for preparingfor the war making guns and apart from your
jewellary and other day to day materials
So of course later on 1498 – 1707 CE likethere was a industrialization of Iron Steel
Brass and Bronze and uhh I think the Britishalso enter into this pictures along with the
French people and there is of course a warin-between the British and also the Tippu
Sultan during 1605 to 1761 CE and this isof course the British Empire time and where
modern metal technology were used for makingthe rockets and also the iron guns were been
developed
So if you look at the metal and metallurgybasically was a part and parcel of Indian
life in ancient time So if you look at Archaeo-metallurgicalEvaluation method at this moment if you want
to do then we will have to follow certainprinciples that is occurrence of minerals
and their processing technology one has toidentify not only that also details regarding
excavation sites settlement and industriesone has to also look at One should have some
experience in the related fields so that youcan identify what are the things going on
and evaluation of socio-economic networkswhat was prevailing at that time and also
we need to look at what was the environmentat that time which was instrumental for the
growth of the technology what it was prevailinguhh in ancient time
So when you look at the study you will haveto look at in a totality not in an isolated
manner so that is the important message weneed to learn and it is not only for the metallurgy
but for other things other technologies aswell If you look at Life Cycle of Archaeological
Metallic Artifacts what we can get and identifyand then try to find out that when it was
how it was being fabricated and how it isevolved Then of course the natural world that
provides the basically ore and once we getthe ore we will have to uhh smelt it and when
we smelt there will be also the slag whichwill be produced right
And out of this uhh smelting we can get thebloom and then when we smith also we get the
slag See if you look at the slag again willbe coming out of the smithing and we can produce
some artifacts and artifacts when you uselike you can use and then you can discard
also but you can also preserve it right andyou may lose it And when you do that like
it can be you know all these three thingscan be again coming to the potential artifacts
And when we talk about potential artifactsit may corrode or there might be some corrosion
If there is a corrosion it may go back tothe natural world right it may go back to
the natural world due to corrosion right Anduhh of course these potential artifacts you
can recover you can analyze it right you candisplay it After recovering this potential
artifacts you can display it you can analyzeit to find out what are the components
I have put that thing in a little you knowcycled manner not that the way it is linearly
it is been shown in this So if you look atwhen you talk about these artifacts basically
it will be used and it can be also what youcall when you use you can discard also right
You can discard it and when you discard youmay also lose it and when you there might
be a some uhh loss and then we will go tothe uhh potential artifacts and then we can
re-use it also that is another way And onceyou do it re-use uhh because then discard
it will be re-used then you can get to thesmithing and smithing when you talk about
that there might be a slag right the wholecycle it goes on So by that way one can look
at this you know archaeological metallic artifactsto find out how good or how bad and then for
your analysis
Now let us look at a brief history of theIndian Metallurgy and of course there was
metallurgy in the Indus Valley Civilizationwhat we are calling now Indus-Saraswathi Civilization
or uhh Jindi me kehte hain Sindhughati sabhyatharight And as per the R.S.Sharma in 1988 has
written an article on historical archaeologyof India of course I have taken that from
the History of technology in India Vol-1 editedby A.K.Bag INSA New Delhi
According to R.S.Sharma several metals werebeing used for making various tool tools for
agriculture defense and transport by landand sea And he has given lot of examples Rig
Veda Sruti and Yajur Veda That is anotherauthor also Prakash mentioned the importance
of fire discovery for processing of metalsAnd the Rishi Angirasa uhh is considered to
be the discoverer of fire Because fire isthe prime mover of the all the civilization
what we can think of So therefore Uhh alsohe has mentioned that the Yagnakundas or the
fire places like was a open laboratory wherelot of experimentation might have been done
And they might have learnt a lot about themetal and metal processings Uhh But unfortunately
they did not write down uhh in a very systematicmanner except in a cryptic way they are mentioned
in the Vedas There might be the reason isthat like people were transferring the knowledge
from one generation to another but in theirown clan or in their own family but they were
not giving to others that might be one ofthe reasons why you know they did not write
it down on a very elaborate way
And even that kind of mind set is prevailingtoday because why I am saying with confidence
uhh one of my student who is from uhh Trivandrumlike his family was having a uhh what you
call technology of making the idols usingthe lost works method And I asked them to
make a video for this course and then so thatwe can show but he told it cannot be done
because it is a secret So therefore even todayit is happening so it might be the one reason
what Prakash has mentioned
And beside this uhh if you look at nativemetals like Gold Silver Copper Iron have been
the first to be discovered as early as 6000to 1 million year BCE in India that he has
claimed And of course you will get a lot ofinformation about the metal and metallurgy
in the Arthashastra Although if you look atearlier days people were using arrow kind
of things here right and arrow and the bowand some people says that the bow will be
little flexible in nature but arrow will havethis is a metal So uhh which were being very
much you know uhh being used in ancient Indiaif you go to our mythological stories and
other things you will find that our warriorswere carrying the uhh bow and arrows
If you look at the Arthashastra which is theone of the earliest Indian text has mentioned
about mineralogical characteristics of metallicores other mineral aggregate rocks and I will
be discussing some of them and of course theyhave not described the way the modern people
are familiar with But however from their descriptionone can find out that those are the these
materials
It recognizes also the ores in the earth inthe rocks or in the liquid form with excessive
colour heaviness and often strong smell andtaste These are the things they were using
for characterizing the uhh ores and materialslike a colour heaviness or a smell taste So
Uhh and he has mentioned a gold bearing orein that text.
In the similar manner silver ore was describedin Arthashastra which seems to be a complex
Sulphide ore containing Silver and they arementioned that uhh you know this ore will
be having colour of conch-shell And they havealso talked about the camphor and vimalaka
or pyrites The Arthashastra describes thesources and the qualities of good grade Gold
and Silver ores Gold melting was known asa suvarnapaka You know like pakam means basically
cooking and they are talking about cookingof the you know Gold that is the suvarnapaka
As I told that you know this is the Gold orewhich you know looks like the whatever the
description they have given in the text ofthe Arthashastra So this is about copper ore
and you know the colour wise you can see andfrom this one can identify And according to
the Arthashastra by Kautilya the Copper oreswere stated to be `heavy greasy and tawny’
and this if it is of course Uhh kind of thisthing then it is a one can identify that colour
has to be chalcopyrite left exposed to airuhh and then gets tarnished And there might
be some other varieties of Copper ore thatis a green colour of malachite and there is
a dark blue with yellowish tint azurites andpale red native copper There are various kinds
of Copper ores are being mentioned in theArthashastra text
Lead ores were stated to be a greyish blacklike kakamecaka means colour of galena If
you look at the galena you know is looks likethat the lead ore And you know this kakamecaka
the colour of galena was the black the greyishblack looks to be the similar one that of
the galena right And there are some otherthings like yellow like pigeon bile marked
with white lines [quartz or calcite gangueminerals] and smelling like a raw flesh [odour
of Sulphur] You know they have having thesecharacteristics to identify the ore which
happens to be the you know Lead
So Iron ore was known to be greasy stone ofpale red colour or the colour of a sinduvara
flower or Hematite Of course there are variouskinds of you know iron ores are mentioned
in uhh some other text which I will be discussinglater on when we will be talking about iron
and its uses So Arthashastra also describesa system coinage based on Silver Copper They
are having a very standard units of measuringthe weight of uhh these materials in a Silver
and Copper coin They use masaka half masakaquarter masaka known as kakani and half kakani
Also like if you look at they were havingusing for Gold different kind of masakas and
then for Silver different kind both are notsame uhh weight kind of things And Copper
coins progressively lower weights you knowas compared to the Silver had the same composition
like one quarter hardening alloy and the restCopper So you know copper they might have
used you know alloy as the coin and let meshow you a coins of Ashoka This is a basically
a Silver coins which were made during thetime of Ashoka
And when you talk about metallurgy of puremetals in India then we will talk about various
processes For Gold there is a gravity separationwhich we will be discussing And Silver and
Lead – Roasting and reduction smelting Copper– uhh Carbothermic reduction of cuprites
and Iron and Steel – Smelting of Iron oreSo we will be discussing all these processes
how Indians were making in ancient time
So if you look at Gold Gold is a very veryductile metal and it has a higher corrosion
and oxidation resistance One gram of Goldcan be drawn into more than 1.24 km long wire
without any intermediate annealing So thatis why it has been used very easily for jewelleries
very nice jewellery you can find even todayalthough it was being done earlier days by
hand now it is machine is making And I alwaysemphasize that you know a hand is you know
should be kept or the what you call this artof making the jewelry must be kept so that
mind will be developed But as Gold is a softmaterial uhh then it cannot be really used
for any war weapons uhh or any other placeswhere the hardness is called for
If you look at according to researcher uhhNeolithic men around 4500-2000 BCE would have
first become acquainted with native Gold inIndia In India not many Gold artifacts dating
to the Pre-Harappa period have been reportedThat is a very contradictive statement but
however we could not get much But in Vedicliterature Gold has been mentioned several
times as Hiranya So therefore it might beyou know Vedic period Gold you know uhh having
a prominence
And recurrence of this metal in Copper ageparticularly 5th millennium is more common
and many artifacts have been reported formSouth India And even today also the in South
India Gold is considered to be the very importantand they are having lot of uhh Gold ornaments
and also they uhh hoard a lot of Golds
So India has the distinction that the deepestancient mines in the world for the Gold come
from the Maski region of Karnataka with Carbondates from the mid one 1st millennium BC So
this is you know one of the oldest Gold minesin the entire world India is having and that
I have shown here This is still you know itis people are using it and they have done
open cast kind of things they were using youknow very road and different ways Kolar and
Hatti Gold mines were being worked even inprehistoric times
And it has been proved beyond doubt that theSouth Indians had learnt the technology of
mining Gold established the smelting technologyon a commercial scale and metal was being
traded through the Lothal by sea route tothe Harappa Mohenjo-Daro and even Egypt Greece
Rome and Africa and other countries With thiswe will stop over here
