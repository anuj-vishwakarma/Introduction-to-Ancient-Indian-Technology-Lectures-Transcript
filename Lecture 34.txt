Let us start this lecture with a thought processthat is smile begets smile In the last lecture
we basically started the discussion on thegold and later on we moved into the lead and
silver because both the lead and silver arebeing Uhh discussed Uhh together and as it
was being processed earlier days Uhh in thesame way Today we will be discussing about
copper Copper plays a very important roleand it is a part of our civilisation and culture
Even today also we are using copper utensilsand other things for our rituals You know
for performing rituals we do use copper Thediscovery of this metal marks the beginning
of Chalcolithic period around 2800-1000 BCEAnd this also is known as the copper age Uhh
men started using metal instead of stone orthe clay to fabricate the hunting tools domestic
utensils etc
And you will find that lot of euphorias arethere among some Uhh people today that copper
is having a lot of therapeutic values Of courseone has to check about that because copper
vessels Uhh from ancient time Uhh were beingheld by Indians to be sacred and almost all
utensil meant for use in religious ceremoniesare invariably made of copper even at the
present time as I had mentioned earlier
Copper sulphate minerals was given the name'Fool’s Gold' and owing to its shining yellow
colour Of course Uhh it is not really thecopper rather it will be the brass which can
be considered as yellow The first and oldestevidence of copper artifacts in India date
backs to the Nal cemetery Uhh something 3rdmillennium BCE There is evidence also the
Forbes in 1964 Uhh had mentioned that KingDevius of Iran had a brass cup dating back
to 522 to 486 BCE Its origin was probablybelonged to India and Rai also has mentioned
that discovery of hollow copper gold and silverbeads belong to the Harappan period which
were manufactured in two halves and then solderedtogether
And Uhh as I told earlier that people werealso making some kind of a gold spheres by
using the surface tension force and copperand bronze chariot from the Daimabad Hoard
of Maharashtra dating back to 1500 BCE andit has been casted this figure I have shown
you here The copper or maybe bronze chariotis being casted in one piece by the investment
casting people call it cire perdue process
Maybe if you will time will permit Uhh wewill be discussing about this investment costing
Maybe I will try to devote one lecture onthat and Uhh of course during Harappan period
The several copper Uhh materials or copperUhh artifacts being used and according to
Vasant Shinde who is the vice chancellor ofDeccan university and he has actually written
an article Current perspectives on Harappancivilization in a comparison to south asia
in past He has mentioned that copper and bronzeplates like this whatever I have shown here
from Mohenjo-daro were probably used exclusivelybe wealthy upper class city dwellers because
it was it might be the costly
Copper tablets with a Uhh you know raisedscripts found in Trench of 43 If you look
at these are scripts Uhh which is to be unravelledkind of things they found in Harappan region
Ledged cooking vessel with high neck and flaringrim if you look at this having a neck and
flaring rim this one Uhh utensils are beingused even today and he thinks that it must
have made in two pieces and joined togetherby cold hammering Uhh at the ledge
And Uhh this vessel contained a hoard of copperweapons and tools which I have shown here
These are the weapons right these are thekind of weapon people were using at that time
And Uhh copper knife with bone handle If youlook at this is basically bone and this is
copper knife were found Uhh at Gola Dhororegions So it is the if you look at the copper
Uhh were being used in by the Harappan peopleas being you know discussed in the article
of Vasant Shinde
And Uhh massivity of the copper objects madein the past can be judged from the tapered
copper bolt of 620 mm and this is the copperbolt which was huge in length and having 49.15
diameter this diameter right And the Uhh thisis basically Uhh smaller diameter like 49.15
mm and this is a bigger one 56.9mm at thecentre right And this bolt was used to join
the two pieces Particularly this this emblemof the lion to this pillar and Uhh this is
the Ashokan Pillar and Uhh which was foundat Rampurva near Nepal which dates back to
300 BCE kind of thing And now it is preservedin Calcutta National Museum
There are several archeological evidence aboutthe copper Uhh uses And objects of various
shapes are being made by casting and maybeclaymoulds and sometimes people use hot and
cold forging to make these objects of copperAncient craftsmen had a flare to produce beautiful
design in copper objects by embossing engravingand gem setting Also people were using this
copper by polishing it properly you know asa mirror This is the mirror which I have shown
and this is the main portion of the mirrorwhich is polished well Polished mirror and
when I was a kid I had seen similar mirrorin one village earlier you know it was a piece
which was being you know kept as a piece inone of the rich person home
So if you look at this Uhh bolt which I discussedin the very beginning It was having something
24.5 inch long inches of long of the sizeSo Uhh here I have shown you a Buddha statue
which is Uhh basically Uhh being unravelledin Sultan Ganj by a British officer who was
Mr Harris a Resident Engineer in East IndiaRailway company Right and Uhh now this Buddha
statue is being kept in Birmingham Museumin UK
And it was 7 feet and 6 inch high and itsweight was estimated to be around 1 ton this
figure you know One very important part whichwas observed by Dr Mitra about this Uhh statue
that the outer garments see if you look atthis there is the outer garments which is
of course you can see from here this portionwas made in such a way that body you know
is Uhh visible through the outer garment
Dr Mitra has described the process of constructionof this Uhh statue as that material is a very
pure copper cast in two layers the inner onein segments on an earthen mould and held together
by iron bands and these iron bands were originallyof an inch of thick Uhh but unfortunately
at that time it is might be rusted out
The casting of the face down to the breastwas effected in one piece that means till
this you know this one piece it might havedone And the lower part down to knee in another
piece knee kind of things right tell kneeAnd then the leg and feet hands and back in
several other pieces outer layer of the copperseems to have been cast over the inner one
Presumably by the invest I mean casting processSo if you look at how they are joining and
so seamlessly These are the question one needto ask Uhh but however more research is to
be carried out How it was fabricated in ancienttime such a colossal you know statue Beside
this statue there is a also mention of anothervery big statue which is 80 feet in height
of the same Buddha image Lord Buddha whichwas described by celebrated Chinese traveller
Hiuen-Tsiang who came around 630-644 CE duringthe Harshwardhan period and Uhh he has written
in his travel log that he saw it standingIt means the Buddha statue to be standing
upright towards the east of the great Nalandaconvent
Because Nalanda was having university so atthat time So in that university this status
was there But where is that statue today thatnobody knows So therefore this is the only
from the travel log written by the Chinesetraveller Hiuen-Tsiang that we could get Copper
ores and its extraction of copper in AncientIndia
Let us look at how they were doing Of theores copper known as ancient the copper pyrites
were the most important ones Beside this thereare copper glance malachites and red copper
also Uhh present but they are not very muchused or not known well known Regarding Uhh
compounds of copper The sulphide and sulphateswere considered to be prepared artificially
for example like the blue vitriol that iscopper sulphate as well as the green vitriol
iron sulphate were known from the 3rd centuryBCE because in the Arthashastra it has been
mentioned about this blue vitriol and greenvitriol
And it is very important that the differencebetween these two vitriols were there in Uhh
the scriptures of Ancient India but unfortunatelyyou know during that time 3rd century BCE
it was not even suspected in Europe That meansIndians were knowing about this two Uhh blue
vitriol and green vitriol much before theUhh European could think of The most common
mineral copper found in India is basicallychalcopyrite and Uhh chalcopyrite is a copper
iron sulphide mineral that crystallizes intetragonal system
Chalcopyrite has been reported to occur atKhetri in Rajasthan Surda and Mosabani and
Rakha of Singhbhumi which is the copper beltof Jharkhand Even today also we are having
lot of copper ore mines So other copper mineralsone can think of Malachites which is the chemical
formula is given here Azurite Cuprite of coursethe Chalcopyrite We will be discussing about
some process how it can be you know used forrefining this Chalcopyrite and Chalcopyrite
figure is shown here
Reduction of cuprite can be done very easilyby adding this you know carbon which is basically
the wood charcoal were being used at thattime and when you heat it it will be getting
into copper and then carbon monoxide And thisis of course a Uhh endothermic reaction You
will have to give some heat into that andonce you have burned this charcoal you know
like it will be used And this really doesn’tinvolve Uhh very complicated process like
the when we deal with the copper sulphideThe copper extraction process from the Chalcopyrite
is quite complex as shown here and Uhh keepin mind there is two process which is being
done One is roasting which occurs at around850 degree Celsius
Chalcopyrite will be reacting with oxygenand it will give cuprous oxide ferrous sulphide
and sulphur dioxide Then if you heat it furtheryou will get CuO Iron and sulphur dioxide
and Uhh reduction will be taking place around1200 degree Celsius and where the cuprous
oxide will be reacting with ferrous oxideand carbon and of course the some silica will
be present in that and you will be at 1200degree Celsius of course that is a little
difficult to get this temperature
And you can get the copper and carbon dioxideand this is the fayalite or the slag This
portion is the basically the slag which willbe removed out of this and then that is known
as fayalite And as I mentioned just now thatthe production of copper from the chalcopyrite
is basically a two step process involvingprecise control of thermochemisty because
unless you control this temperature preciselyyou will not get really the right thing
So therefore it is very important to havea control over that And besides this Uhh there
are several process of this preparing copperis being mentioned in the Rasa Ratna Samuccaya
and these processes are basically meant toproduce the copper in a small scale the process
of extraction of copper from chalcopyriteYou just say ayurvedic route using the lemon
juice as a chemical
In Uhh 1990 the Jha in Uhh IIT BHU Uhh conductedexpreriments to find out whether this process
given in Rasa Ratna Samuccaya is correct ornot by using the method by considering 100
cc of lemon juice and 100 grams of ore andhe conducted experiment very diligently and
also reported in his PhD thesis
In this process after purification sodhanawhat the you call in Hindi is chalcopyrite
following the Ayurvedic process of ore mineralwas roasted at 750-900 degree Celsius adding
the lemon juice during this process And duringthis roasting process copper and iron get
converted into citrates Roasted ore was mixedwith the 25 percent of Borax which acts as
a flux and more of the lemon juice and themixture was pressed into 20 to 30 mm of balls
Like they form these balls out of this mixingand these balls were dried in the sun Then
melted in the silimanite that is Al2SiO5 andlined crucibles Again that you know this crucible
is specially being line with this silimaniteand which was heated at 1250 degree Celsius
and on carrying out this melting almost sulphideand gas free copper button Uhh separated from
the liquid slag was obtained
That means they could prepare this copperbottoms out of this That means it is very
clear from this experiment that the processwhich is given in the Rasa Ratna Samuccaya
is possible and one can use that method eventoday
So Uhh we will be discussing about anotherprocess of forming copper in a small quantities
that is the process of Cementation This processhas been mentioned in the Rasa Ratna Samuccaya
which is based on the precipitation of copperfrom blue vitriol solution that is copper
sulphate In this process the concentratedcopper sulphate solution was kept in an iron
bowl and after certain time a thick layerof copper pure copper particles was deposited
on the iron surface and the solution was removedand copper was collected by scraping it away
from this iron surface
This is a very simple process and Uhh if youlook at the reaction Copper sulphate reacting
with iron became iron sulphate and then copperAnd Uhh pure copper was carefully washed with
water free from the sulphate and used forthe preparation of copper bhasma Because in
earlier days people were using the copperbhasma gold bhasma and other metal bhasmas
for the ayurvedic so therefore this processbeing devised So if you look at the processes
what I have described till now
Most of the things they mixed the naturalproducts natural ingredients and then make
it For example lemon juice is being used hereAnd Uhh that is the thing what need to be
relook at it and also we can find out whetherwe can revive this processes And beside this
if you look at the copper also being usedfor making the brass items and also the there
are several dhatus like navadhatu asthadhatusand several alloys people have used using
the copper and other alloys
And I will just show a picture and which isabout the statue of an Baraha which is made
of this copper material and it has very intricatesteps and how they fabricate a such a intricate
statue and keep in mind that this Baraha isbasically carrying a earth And this earth
if you go to our mythology is basically roundin nature so therefore lot of science and
this thing are there in our sculptures andalso the idols and then this thing we can
learn about that how they were knowing
And this process can be tested even todaywith the method mentioned in the scriptures
the text like Rasa Ratan Samuccaya and severalother scriptures are available even today
And we can revive this process and which aresimple in nature So with this we will stop
over Thank you very much and Uhh in the nextlecture we will be discussing about how the
iron was being made in this or iron makingprocesses and how iron was Uhh being used
in Ancient India Thank you very much
