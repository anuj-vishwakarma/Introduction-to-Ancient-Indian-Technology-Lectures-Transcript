Let us start this lecture a thought processfrom Chhandogya Upanishad It is the water
which pervades everything big or small theearth the atmosphere the heaven the mountains
gods men animals birds grass plants dogs wormsinsects ants All these are water indeed Today
we will be basically discussing about thewater and how to harvest it also the irrigation
system few lectures I will be devoting onthat which were being practice in ancient
time
If you look at this is a beautiful planetyou know it is you can consider to be a blue
planet and that is our mother Earth Why itlooks so beautiful Because water is there
And let us look at that as per the ChhandogyaUpanishad the water is everything so also
even our body contains 70 percent of the waterThe whole Earth contains you know 70 percent
of water but if you look at what is the amountof water or the fresh water that we can use
If you look at total global water here theocean contains 96.5 percent which are saline
in nature we cannot use it And another 1 percentof water total water will be saline that means
the total water which is fresh and which isconsidered to be fresh water is around 2.5
percent Out of these 2.5 percent the 68.6percent one cannot use because the glacier
and ice caps And there will be also groundwater 30.1 percent ground water that means
you will have to take it out from the groundusing some energy or the now we are using
now a days (mot) pump and also motor to extractthe water from the ground and surface water
is something 1.3 percent Out of that 1.3 percentthe 73.1 percent is basically ice and snow
and another 20.1 percent is are lakes it isvery difficult to use that even
Then you will be having soil moistures becausesoil also contains certain amount of moisture
3.5 percent And when we discuss about theagriculture we are concerned about how to
detain the moisture in the soil That was agreat challenge for the agriculturist and
today it is difficult to have because of globalwarming because of wrong practices of the
agriculture or the forming and also the greenerycoverage those are uh you know receding or
reducing the soil moisture content And thenthe swamps or the marshes or something 2.5
percent rivers are 0.46 percent right thetotal water water it contains and then of
course atmosphere will be 0.22 percent atmospherealso contains some water and living things
like 0.22 percent If you look at the amountof water which are available to us for our
uses are quite less And then we are what weare doing we are misusing it abusing it right
and then spoiling it also so far quality isconcerned
If you look at average daily water uses forperson is graph being plotted here these are
the on this side these are uh you know litersper person per what this on the left hand
side the average daily usage of water perperson has been shown here right in this these
are the countries like USA Australia you knowall those countries are there you can observe
that this water uses is decreasing with thecountries and these countries are basically
undeveloped countries ok And USA AustraliaItaly Japan Mexico all those are developed
countries In developed countries per personusage water is higher and India is in between
which is around something 130 liters per personare you getting That means if you will be
more developed you will be using more amountof water That is the one yardstick like the
way we also judge whether you are developedor not developed energy consumption per person
per capita in energy consumption
And as we will be developing the so calleddevelopment what we are seeing that means
we will be using more amount of water wherewater will come And also we will be contaminating
the water But if you look at our ancient wayof looking at use less in modern days in consumeristic
society it is the consume more that meanswe need to follow that consume less amount
of water for your survival for your life andthat should be the thing we should learn And
fortunately we are having very less amountof water usage per person as compared to the
developed countries and we should keep itbut unfortunately due to this industrialization
urbanization and other things our consumptionfor person you know water is increasing at
an alarming rate and there will be a problemok
So let us look at the even report like waterfor life has come up Around 700 million people
in 43 countries suffer today from water scarcityand that is UNA report data And by 2025 if
look at after 8 years today is 2017 18 billionpeople will be living in countries or regions
with absolute water scarcity and two thirdsof the worlds population could be living under
water stressed conditions right 2025 And ifyou look at 2030 what will happen With the
existing climate change scenario because theclimate has been changing global warming the
temperature has gone up Almost half of theworlds population will be living in areas
of high water stress by 2030 These are ofcourse prediction but still there will be
something will be there you know not thatit will go loft sided
Including 75 million people and 250 millionpeople in Africa this will be affected by
the water In addition water scarcity in somearid or semi arid places will displace between
24 million to 700 million people they arepredicting because water will notbe there
they will have to shift they will have togo move to some other place where water will
be there otherwise you cannot survive Andsub Saharan African has the largest number
of water stressed countries of any regionOf course Asia is the next after Africa is
here the next because it is a populous placeand we need to face the problem for water
And we are also spoiling the water qualityby drainage system you know putting the sewage
into our rivers most of Indian rivers arepolluted you know not only the Ganga but any
other river you can think of right
And also the we are not taking care of uhwhat you call preserving it and the even you
know water And underground water is also contaminatedto to some extent rather you know particularly
in urban area is water is contaminated undergroundwater Now where we will go because water is
the elixir of life without water can you thinkof any life Forget about any development may
be right And that is about global scenarioI guess let us look at water crisis in India
I will be giving you a very you know a briefview of the thing The states which are hit
by the water scarcity is Rajasthan Uttar PradeshMadhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh Andhra Pradesh
Tamil Nadu of course the Gujarat Maharashtraand very few states were are not affected
by you know water scarcity And if you lookat this is a picture what I have shown few
here this is New Delhi Municipality CorporationNew Delhi capital where people are on this
tank sitting around and they want water andsimilarly here in Rajasthan the women folk
they are walking may be 2 3 kilometers toget water And this is of course in Natwarghad
in Gujarat the there is a what you call largewell and people are swarming around that well
to get some water These are real picturesyou know right situations situation is quite
alarming
So now if you look at water supply durationin 20 major cities and this is of course Rajkot
which is having very less number of hoursmay be you know half an hour per day And of
course the Chandigarh if you look at is having12 hours per day on an average Rest of the
things Mumbai Jabalpur Bangalore having youknows all these things these are the 20 cities
where people are not getting 24 hours watersupply Of course in IIT Kanpur we get it is
a luxury for us you know right So the problemis quite grieved it is quite alarming and
we are having 130 crore people and may beit will be after few years it will be 135
or 140 after 10 years 20 years like that Solet us look at what are the main causes of
present water crisis in India
And of course there is a rising populationtherefore demand for water is increasing Over
extraction of easily available surface waterand ground water resources because we are
having now electricity and then we are havingalso the uh what do you call diesel set gen
set generator set where you can use that powerto extract you know water from the this thing
and we also misuse the water for agriculturebecause now a days water is free for farmer
like then it will be all they will be misusingAnd besides this whatever water is there also
we what to call not use properly and alsothat is contaminated that is a one problem
So increasing human impact on the environmentand contamination of available water sources
because as I told earlier that our sewagesystem you know we are putting into the rivers
And so industrial herbs or (indus) industriesthey are also putting their garbage into the
river because that is a poor you know fellowlike nobody to take care of river and so there
is a thing Beside this there is a climatechange of course global warming the evaporation
rate is increasing and then also water isscanty Scanty in the sense some places of
course too much of water is coming and thensome other places there is a problem and excessive
environmental degradation in catchment areasIf look at catchment area means mountains
and other hills and other places if look atthose are flooded with what With lot of garbage
people are going for tourist right and thenthey are putting lot of materials leaving
as it is and coming back those are contaminatedright because of this tourism you know is
become a business so therefore that is creatinga lot of problems in the pollution in the
catchment area
And the catchment area means encroached bythe people also earlier days people do not
want and then mountains they are disseminatinglike from there it will come And then pollution
of river water ground water I have alreadytalked about it and gross mismanagement of
the land and water resources because in asI told in agriculture we are using lot of
chemicals today and those are you know likepercolated when water comes you know you are
using irrigation that also coming to the soiland then other things it is affecting And
like of course there is a problems as a resultthey will be droughts floods and landslides
uh you might be aware that Himalayan regionis now more prone to land sides because people
have blasted it you now for making houses
Those are rocks are being together you knowthere any time it can crumble because lot
of blastings are going on to make home orto quarries and then you know take out so
these are the things we should not spoil Andsome of the floods of course people have put
a lot of dams in the rivers as a result youknow they are not having good management and
they whenever they will get pressure fromthe water due to water load or due to mismanagement
they will release the water so there is alsofloods comes you know man made Now a days
some floods at least not all but some of themare man made as being told to me and why it
is so Because we are following unsustainablematerialistic western way of life in the name
of development or the modernity without reallythinking that look those things cannot work
for here because India is a populous countryWe cannot have you know like a system where
people will just misuse it and give them freelyno
So then we need to look at like what you calluh our ancient Indian wisdom and see how they
were managing the water at that time And howwe can have sustainable water (harve) harvest
harvesting system right That we can learnfrom them and re look at it and that is the
objective of basically this course to relookat them how they were managing properly So
if you look at you go to the Sam Veda likeaccording to that one type of water goes up
right Another type of water comes down rainwater flows into rivers right because that
is a one process if you look at it is basicallyhydrological cycle what is talking about in
their own language
Process of according to Yajurveda water basicallymoves from clouds to the earth right because
from the sea it will be evaporated and thenit will go and then wherever mountain and
other places greenery will be there it willcondense and rain will be forming and flow
through channels and again it will go andstore in the ocean right So this is the cycle
and of course there will be evaporation andthere will be infiltration kind of thing in
the soil So this is a beautiful cycle rightwhat nature is doing for us
Now if you imagine that we want to use thesea water which is saline and evaporate it
condense it and use it right Will it not bevery costly It will be extremely costly but
nature is doing for us what we need to doAnd nature has also has created how to collect
wherever the peo you know will be there thatis why all components of nature like mountains
jungles all other things rivers are alreadydesigned by the nature we need to protect
it that is all and then use it right Thatis the thing what is being uh basically we
can learn from these things
And if you look at this is the we alreadyknow that is uh basically uh if you look at
there is a sea here and you might be awarethat sea marine life is very important But
we are we are all already spoiling the marinelife particularly the coastal nearby area
even in the deep sea also being spoiled byus because of exploration because of other
things And this evaporation will be cloudand then again cloud will move towards that
there will be mountains and then you knowand also greenery that will be precipitation
condensation precipitation then water willbe coming through all this land areas there
might be run offs right And even some it willbe inflated it will go and as a ground water
if you look at these are the ground waterright will be stored and then you can use
right that water also so this is a beautifulsystem is there in place by the nature but
we are spoiling it in the name of what Developmentin the name of you know what you call modernity
So that we need to look at that nature isdivine as being talked in our scriptures and
we will we are a part of it It is not thehuman being alone will be enjoying the fruits
of the nature or the resources of the natureothers also should have But they will not
do any damage can an animal will do damageto the nature No na it is the human being
who can spoil it So that is the thing we canlearn from uh what you call ancient way of
looking at this hydrological cycle which wasmentioned in the Veda in a little different
way And let us look at Birds eye view of waterharvesting systems in our country
And what I am showing here is a very verybrief things right It is a very vast so I
cannot really talk about it But however Iwill say that 3000 BC or even more before
that we have seen in Indus Valley Civilizationyou know like people found dams built of stone
rubble in Baluchistan and Kutch region ofGujarat And of course during Indus Valley
Civilization what we call it now SaraswatiCivilization at several reservoirs to collect
rainwater runoff Each house had an individualwell and so also public well they were having
And 321 291 BC if you look at uh archeologicalevidence for dams lakes irrigation systems
during the time of Chandragupta Mauryas ruleyou know people have found out
And even uh if you look at during that timeKautilyas Arthasastra which we had talked
several time uh it has mentioned the irrigationusing water harvesting system and even at
that time there was a provision for taxingthe farmer whoever uses water from the irrigation
system Existing irrigation is not free oklike today we are giving free to the people
Freely give to the people then they will misuseit And the first century BC if you look at
Sringaverapura near Allahabad had a sophisticatedwater harvesting system which I will be discussing
and also controlling the flood waters of GangesThat means you know you will have to there
is a flood whenever there will be there isa river there will be flood but that also
you can use it for your advantages and managethe your water need
And 2nd Century AD is a Grand Anicut or thewhich is also known as Kallanai uh anicut
like built by Karikala Chola king right acrossthe river Cauvery to divert water for irrigation
which is still functional today even todayright and it is a very old Then of course
there are several other things but I am comingto 11th Century AD King Bhoja of Bhopal built
large artificial lakes around 65000 acresin India fed by streams and springs of that
area right They have joined altogether liketoday people are talking about joining rivers
they had joined also springs but they werehaving certain understanding right
And 12th Century AD Rajatarangini by Kalhanadescribed a well maintained irrigation system
in Kashmir which I will be discussing becausethose things were managed by the people at
that time not the king who is you know supposedto manage Today government is trying to manage
everything but at that time people were managingtheir own resources right there is a difference
of governance So uh let us look at uh youknow Historical Perspective of well and water
bodies like what are the things
So if you look at the large number of wellswithin the housing complex at Mohenjo Daro
and Harappan clearly indicates the importanceof water for domestic purposes and ritual
ritualistic purposes And the occurrence ofword Avata which is basically well repeatedly
used in Rigveda which indicate that the Vedicpeople were knowing how to dig a well and
use it right Of course uh during Mauryan ruleas I told earlier farmers use to pay taxes
for using well and also the (irri) other irrigationsystem fitted with the machine of course There
is nothing much about those machines whichare being used I presume there might be some
water wheels or something to you know takeout the water kind of things And the Kautilyas
Arthasastra had mentioned about that
And besides these Paninis Asthadhayayi uhas already talked about two words of course
there might be more words also but what Ihave mentioned here is Karakandu and Sakandu
One is permanent well dug on the right sideof the river I do not know really why right
side you know that is one question comingto mind And another in temporary on left side
of the river that is subjected to annual inundationsthere will be annual inundations and inundation
means flood will be coming And it may happenthat flood is moving towards the what you
call uh right side that is why that well mightbe temporary whereas the left side might be
you know stable one or may be having embankmentwhich is flood will not go
People uh have also you know while studyingthis I learnt that people are having embankment
on the river one side they allow one riverwater to flood in other side you know that
means they wer having certain control overthe rivers uh movement right If you are having
good embankment one side and other you allowthen anywhere you are what will come that
will be that will be going so that is theone uh reason what you know came to my mind
Of course in early Tamil anthologies thereare several collection of poems like Manimekalai
and Tirukkural Purananuru Pattinappalai etcof course I am sorry uh I am not pronouncing
this Tamil word properly uh I think my myTamil friends will tolerate me And terms related
to water well namely Kuoal Kulam and KinaruVani Keni there are several words are there
which are used profusely in these literaturesof Tamil Nadu Uh that means they were concerned
about well right and how to make and otherthings
Besides this Dharma Shastras mention fourtypes of man made water receivers like that
means you know if you were having if you coulddig well let us say will get some punyas right
and like Kupa Vapi and Puskarini and TadagaLike earlier days uh there was a belief system
on the people if you give your resources ordonate your resources for having a Kupa that
means you know you will do a lot of what youcall punya Punya means what it will be Like
uh uhm good deeds right this is consideredas a good deeds Similarly you know that is
why that believe system was working peoplewere coming forward to give their you know
resources money even their own man power touse that so that public will use it that was
the feeling people were having
And with this I will stop over here and wewill be also discussing about uh the other
you know uh aspects of well and water bodiesad also other things how they were doing and
how the society was doing not the governmentwas doing that is the there is a difference
Today government is trying to do but earlierdays the public things means public will take
care of themselves in a group manner not inindividual manner So therefore society was
alive at that time but today society is almostbe with a begging bowl to the government right
Society should be you know do their own workof doing the things right So with this I will
stop over we will see in the next lectureThank you very much
