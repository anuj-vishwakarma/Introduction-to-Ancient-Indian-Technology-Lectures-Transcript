Let us start this lecture with a thought processby Gautham Buddha Little by little a person
becomes evil as a water pot is filled by dropsof water little by little a person becomes
good as a water pot is filled by drops ofwater In the last lecture we had initiated
certain discussion on temple tank system whicheverwhere there in ancient India If you look at
temple plays a very important role in ourlife particularly in ancient time it was the
centre for propagation of education heritageculture and also the technology to larger
extend which control the life of common humanbeings And therefore the uhh temples were
having water tanks which were not being usedfor everyday usage rather it being utilised
for vital purposes for recharging the undergroundaquifers reducing the runoff enhancing the
water stagnation time thus ensuring sufficientwater in the domestic wells during the summer
months
Let us look at one example where we will seethat lot of water bodies around a temple that
is Jagannath temple in Puri of Odisha Thisis a beautiful temple I have shown here but
if you look at we are discussing not aboutthe temple structure rather about the water
bodies around this temple The one tank whichis known as Narendra sarovar was constructed
basically during the this temple constructionbut however the history says that this pond
was created during 13th century by NarendraMahapatra the minister to Kavi Narasimha Deva
in 13th century at a distance around 1 kmon the north side of Sri Jagannath temple
And the size is 873 feet long and 743 widethis is quite huge tank I have shown here
in this picture which you can see at the centreof this huge sarovar or what we call in English
Pond it is having a small temple also
And which is having a utility maybe for thearchitectural beauty one is but other things
it would be that it will be acting as a measureof water in the tank Besides these not in
this sarovar or the pond but in other placessome step wells are being used to recharge
the water inside And here very interestingthing if you look at this is the bridge which
is there for people to move around and thisis the (())(329) system is being used if you
look at and that similar structures are therein the various other bridges which were being
built in ancient time Besides these thereare several other water tanks like Indradyumana
tank located near Gundicha temple which isaround 3 km away from Jagannath temple and
Rohini kunda is a sacred well located withinthe Jagannath temple premise
And the Markandeya tank is around 4 acre insize in the Markandeswar temple which is located
south west of the Jagannath mandir in Markandeswarsahi area and Swethaganga tank is located
to the South of the temple And these are thetanks which are existing but there might be
several other tanks which are not associatedwith the temple but will be around Some of
them might be acquired by the people becausetoday there is a mania for grabbing the land
across the country
Let us look at actually research work is beingdone by CPR environmental education Centre
Chennai who took up survey of something 175temple tank in the South India and they have
also made a very nice map here which you cansee But their work was mainly concentrated
on the Southern side particularly Tamilnaduwhere you can see 116 water bodies associated
with the temple you know they could locatea few years back And besides these of course
Andhra Karnataka and then Kerala but in otherplaces the numbers are very meagre It cannot
be according to me the numbers will be muchhigher so far the sacred water bodies are
concerned
And we need to do research on this and letme just tell you give some data from them
The Tamil Nadu 39 temple tanks were with areafrom point 0.25 to 3 hectors it is very huge
These temple tanks were revered no less thanthe temple itself that means they consider
this as device as the temple that much ofimportance were given to the water bodies
at that time of course not today because weare using the water from the in a pipe and
supplied by the government or local bodiesand we are not careful about the water usage
and it is you know considering it as divine
Some of these sacred tanks supported a varietyof life forms which helped to maintain the
cleanliness of the tank in the natural waybut in modern time we are using mechanical
way We will be putting some kind of a youknow water purification system which is there
in a market but their nature does the purificationthat is the thing we need to learn so that
we need not pay money to the people and whichis unnatural lot of chemicals are entering
in the process of purification of water intoour body and it is spoiling also But unfortunately
this system which was there in the ancientIndia and associated with the temple and other
sacred structures those are being declinedand deteriorated over the years and because
of that most of the ancient temple tanks havefallen into a state of repair and disuse because
most of the technologies in ancient Indianeeds the regular maintenance which we did
not do
Ancient extraction has led to the dying ofsome of the temple tanks because people were
using sparingly the water but today peopleuse profusely right They do not have concern
for that and pressure on the land which Ihad told earlier that today people what to
grab the land and have led to the encroachmentof this dried out tanks And not only these
sacred tanks also the other tanks which arebeing used the secular tanks which are being
used earlier by the people are being takenover by the builders and then other people
and many tanks have become sinks for the sewageand garbage of the neighbourhood Now you know
like water system is fall apart if you lookat the water system is basically in the turmoil
today whatever are existing in the ancientIndia
And let us now talk about irrigation systemin ancient India a question might be coming
to your mind what do we mean by irrigationwhy is irrigation required and was irrigation
system present in any ancient India If youlook at irrigation is basically method of
supplying water to the field for growth ofcrops because crops you know is very important
for the life and I consider that it is theprimary wealth right Agriculture is the primary
wealth or the crops are the primary wealthof us and the rest of us are secondary wealth
but unfortunately the entire wold includingIndia is running after secondary wealth
But still India is considered as the agriculturalcountry since time immemorial and also remain
for years to come because India is a populouscountry and food is essential Our scriptures
says aana pratista deva that meins withoutfood you cannot really do anything So therefore
we need to produce food and for that irrigationis essential keep in mind that according to
Krishna Swami India was international producerin pre historic age unfortunately today also
we are producing but using chemical fertilisersand other things But we need to go back to
the our natural way of farming which I haddiscussed earlier
For that irrigation is very important andessential when rainfall is not sufficient
or occurs in the wrong season because youknow like there is a climate change Therefore
the rain fall is very very erratic and weneed to now learn how to face to challenges
created by the climate change and the globalwarming and by use of irrigation system in
ancient India and also we can improvise itWe can have at least two crops in a year to
meet the demand of the food in this countrythe irrigation system can be divided broadly
into two categories one is natural other isartificial Natural means basically with the
help of reverse springs lakes lakes meansnatural lakes and rain water and others Artificial
means we will have to use tanks pools andthen wells embankments dams etc so that we
can you know store the water rain water andalso the flowing after so that we can utilise
for the irrigation
So let us look at historical prospective ofirrigation system and if you go back to the
Indus valley civilisation to the Mohenjodaroand Harappan sites you will find that also
the evidence of the food grains like wheatbarley and sesame peas etc were some of the
winter crops right which require irrigationwith the help of barrages and canal And you
remember that I had shown you that peoplewere having particularly in you know Mohenjodaro
sites there is a way of utilising the canalsfor the irrigation purposes and the excavation
sites in Rajasthan deserts indicates presenceof irrigation canals
Seasonal damming rivers on the smaller brancheshelps in inundates the lands with the silts
on a smaller river banks enhancing its fertilityfor agriculture In modern dams there is problem
always the silt is big problem getting youknow deposited on the dam itself or the canal
also blocking the portion But earlier dayspeople were using these silts as a fertiliser
in the land by the method of inundate irrigationsystem which we will be discussing let bit
later on And the pottery specimens of deepbrooks and large number of wells found at
Mohenjodaro suggest possibility of risingwater for irrigation purposes During Vedic
period water was considered auspicious andutmost important component of life and according
to RigVeda the water sources can be classifiedas rain water water by digging soil water
oozed from a spring and river and streams
So if you look at it can be basically twotypes of irrigation system what we had discussed
earlier were known to the Vedic farmers thatis natural and artificial If you look at the
water management at the Dholavira you cansee that this is the remnant of a dam on one
side there is a Nullahs basically a canalyou can say or a drain canals so that it is
given some of this portions people are sayingit was might be a dam kind of thing
And besides these people are conjectural alsothe how they could have a structure to strengthen
the dams They were thinking palisade fencesof the wood or metals these are the wood kind
of things and (vert) horizontal and then theseare vertical being placed inside the soil
so that it will give a structural supportto take the water load due to the you know
during the floods and other things on thechannel
So these are the things people are thinkingit might be having and let us look at some
more historical perspective of irrigationsystem In pre Mauryan period irrigation from
water of river canal were used profusely andconstruction of dam was considered as an act
of auspicious and social duty It is even todayalso we feel that kind of social obligation
particularly if you talk with the old peoplein the villages remote villages not modern
villages right you will find that it is veryimportant to have a wells to be done by the
people And that is the practice which theywere having earlier days And even if you go
to the Sabhaparva of Mahabharata Narada isasking Yudhishtira Are large tanks and lakes
constructed all over the kingdom at properdistance without agriculture being the thy
realm of entirely dependent on showers ofheaven that means if you go to the story of
Mahabharata it also very clearly say thatthey were not relying on the rain or the for
the crops they were having irrigation systemin place
And which was the duty of a king to provideand so also maintain by the people And Hathigumpha
of Bhubaneswar of Kharavela around 100 ADdepicts about the canal from Thosali River
If you look at the canal system was therein 100 AD that is the evidence we are having
and Maurya period game much more importanceto agriculture and irrigation system Sudarshana
Lake started by Pusyagupta the governor ofChandra Gupta and completed by Tusapa the
Governor of Asoka was mentioned in the IndicaMegasthenes the book written by Megasthenes
and Artha sastra provides more importanceto irrigation supported by the state and people
In 200 AD the Sudarshana Lake was constructedby Pusyagupta got damaged due to the flood
which was repaired during the reign of Rudradaman1 and during Gupta period this Sudershan Lake
was constructed due the reign of Skandaguptaincurring a huge cost That means you know
if you look at this kind of lake and waterbodies artificial water bodies were also constructed
used and maintained well by the kings andlocal people as well In South India irrigation
were carried out using small tanks and lakesduring even Iron Age
In South India organised irrigation systemwere in work in 100 AD as per the Sangam literary
works Chola king Karikal who was famous forbuilding constructing a great dam on the river
Cauvery which exist till today of course thathas been changed a lot but however it is still
being used by the people And during 700 to1200 AD the enormous growth of irrigation
facility took place by Pandyas of MaduraiPallavas of Kanchi Cholas of Kanjeevara and
Housel of Karnataka Chaukuyas of Kalyani andKakathiyas of Warangal using tanks inundation
canals and channels and wells So if you lookat there is a great you know something around
500 years of history are there who indicatesthe historical evidence of 500 years indicates
that irrigation was prior priority of theyou know rulers in the southern India
And Rastrakuta of Malkhead in Gulbarga districtof Karnataka continued the Deccan tradition
of irrigation system for rural developmentMost of the irrigation works were initiated
and funded by the state but the maintenancepart was managed by the village assembly during
Pallava period And you can see also similarthings are mentioned in Artha Sastra that
it will be done initiated by the king buthowever it has to be managed by the local
people There are two systems during particularlyCholas period one is Erri Variyam a committee
for maintain works of irrigation system whichconsists of 6 members will held office for
360 days of course after that there will bechange of the guard for the people
And besides this there is another separatecommittee which is known as Kalingu Variyam
and which is English if you look at it itis a Sluice committee under the village assembly
which will be taking care of the closing ofthe sluice maintenance of the sluice gates
and other things for controlling the waterto the fields and other places So therefore
it very clearly indicates that there is asystem which plays in Southern India for the
governance of water bodies as well not onlythe construction but governance of those bodies
and how to control that
And during the time of Vikramaditya 6 theBig Tank was constructed Katageri Badami Taluk
in Karnataka for draining of excess waterfrom a tank at higher level to the tank at
the lower levels And Chalukyans of Kalyanihad a separate department for execution and
maintenance of irrigation works They werehaving a separate department like a as of
today and Hoysala Dynasty which lasted aroundsomething 1000 1400 AD also took interest
in making rain fed tanks and canals channelizeriver water to the dry lands for cultivations
Ganapathy deva of Kakatiya dynasty constructedseveral irrigation works consisting of 100
tanks rivulets as per the Hanmakonda NirostiyaKavy inscriptions people got during this period
which talked about this irrigation systemcarried out by this Kakatiya dynasty Pakhal
Lake which is around 80 square miles it isa very huge lake located 13 miles away from
Warangal lies between Krishna and MunnariRiver Ramappa Lake is formed by a ring of
hills on three sides with colossal bund onthe northern side if you look at they were
choosing the natural you know places for examplelike hills and other things and they were
also joining the rivulet such that you canhave a very easily store the water without
much constructional work unlike in the modernsystem Well irrigation were also practised
at that time What do you mean by dam
So if you look at dams are the barriers eithernatural or artificial to hold the flow of
waters And dams were in existence in Indiafrom time immemorial the artificial water
dams was mentioned in Rig Veda as Rodhas whichwere having flood gates like Udha or dura
That is the term what they use and you canthink of using the sluice gate in modern time
So the dam along with the bridge is knownas sethu in Sanskrit Anai in Tamil and as
to Devi Purana the pallibandha or the damprovides its measurements to be around 200
cubits for irrigation system Kunal Jatakawhich is around 400 to 500 BC mentions disputes
between the Sakiya and Koliya tribes for waterdistribution from dam across the river Hohini
And if you look at today also we are havingdispute among the states like your Karnataka
and Tamil nadu about the Cauvery water distributionSimilarly in future also we will be having
because water is going to be a very preciousthing Therefore it very much clearly indicate
that there is a concern for water and howto save it in ancient India and also the related
technology And the Sudarshana lake cum damin Kathiawar which was built around 300 to
457 BC which is very very large like around278 acres is earliest known reservoir that
serves around 400 years without major repairOf course at 150 AD it got damaged by the
flood and was repaired by Rudradaman 1 andagain busted around 456 AD this we have already
discussed
Let us look at the grand Anikut Kallanai whichis I had mentioned was mentioned basically
built on the Cauvery rivers to irrigate thefertile delta region of Cauvery and Kallanai
was constructed with a uncut stone with 329meter long and 20 meter wide and 5.4 meter
high across the main stream of the CauveryIf you look at this figure what I have shown
here it is the modern dam system in the riverCauvery it is not the old one because it was
already been changed a lot by the Britishersand later on by the Government of India And
this Grand Anikut which is known as Kallanaiwas built by Chola king Karikala around the
first century AD
It is one of the oldest water irrigation systemsin the world which is still in use The main
function of Grand Anikut as I tod earlierwas to keep the waters of Cauvery away from
the faster and steeper Kollidam I will beshowing a picture of Kollidam in the next
slide During times while allowing the floodwaters to be safely transported from the Cauvery
which is at higher elevation to the sea viathe Kollidam Kollidam is the river
So if you look at this is the topology ofthe Cauvery River this is the ahkand Cauvery
and it gets bifurcated at this point hereand this river which is the fast stream is
known as Kollidam which goes to the sea Theother portion which is known as the Cauvery
like its having several branches here andthis is the Delta region And this is the Grand
Anikut which was built by the Chola King Karikalaand uh this is a you know is a very important
because this is at a higher elevation andit will be water will be flowing through this
what you call (())(2500) to the fat movingKollidam river And as I told earlier kalliani
was built to harness the water of the riverCauvery in the times of drought right Water
will be there in Cauvery but during the floodor the water excess what will happen
This will excess water will be moving fromthis Cauvery river to the Kollidam thus avoiding
the devastation caused due to the flood Ancientengineers of Bharat had created irrigation
system with innumerable small reservoir withnetworks of irrigation channel which I will
be discussing little later on And the areairrigated by ancient irrigation network is
around 69000 acres But by the early 20th centurythe irrigation land had been increased to
about 1 million acres as I told earlier thisis the river Kollidam and this is the river
Cauvery
Of course bifurcation is somewhere upstreamwhich is not shown in this figure and today
the modern time these are the you know allplaces were being placed but earlier times
it was a dam or what you call the dam wasearlier in this region and nowadays people
call the entire region as the Grand AnikutBut let me tell you that when the Britishers
came into repair this dam which was not beingused for years together due to the war and
other things then they found it was quitedifficult According to one of the British
engineer Baird Smith in 1856 he has givensome evidence writings He says that for nearly
25 years from the time at which Captain Caldwellswork were completed around 1856 incessant
struggle was maintained giant increasing tendencyof the river bed to silt up They were finding
the problems of silting up and then in theprocess what happens they try they could not
understand what the design is
And they made some construction like increasingthe height of the dam and they landed in problems
and these are the problems which are describedin the statements The head and the many parts
of the channel were periodically cleared ofdepots by manual labours long expensive embankment
were carried across the bed of the main streamso as to force large supply of water into
Cauvery branch They were not knowing so theystarted doing all these things and that has
spoiled everything All these however wereineffectual and the bed continued to rise
supply to diminish the extend of land underirrigation year decreased and they were also
getting revenue from that because they weresupplying water to the farmers the revenue
was falling off And the condition of peoplewere visibly becoming worse and worse about
1829 30 the crisis had been reached
So you know they struggled for 25 years theycould not really solve the problems because
they were not knowing the design So uhh letme just show you how it looks and what are
the things how designed it is to give yousome this thing idea this diagrams and other
things ideas also taken from the paper thatis tanks and Anikut of South India Examples
of an alternative science of engineering byChitra Krishnan and Srinivasa B Veeravalli
And if you look at these are the masonarywhich is the actually dam made out of stones
and the shape if you look at it is a wavyshape and these are the earthen bunds which
were having and this also if you look at easternside this is northern side western side there
is also a bund which is a very important formaintaining this things
And there was a war between the two localkings and they were at loggerhead at that
time they did not allow for it to maintainthat is why Britishers came into picture and
then they mediated and then do that So ifyou look at the Cauvery this is the side view
of this you know like Cauvery was having ahigher altitude than then Kollidam the water
has to come from here to there this side viewThere is another interesting feature of this
is that this elevation if you look at thereis a slope right It has a transverse slope
distant from the front of the rear side whichmakes in some parts regular and smooth slopes
in other irregularly by 3 to 4 steps and issomething 1 feet 4 inch kind of difference
are there And people do not understand whyit is so What for it is
And what they did they raised this heightyou know they raised this heights of this
masonary work at the stone work and then theythought that they will you know solve the
problem and the problem was what you callworst As I told earlier this features what
you call making 2 or 3 waves from one andother there is a wavy structure actually its
crest was not level but sloppy higher at thewestern end than the eastern end that I had
shown you like 1 feet 4 inch kind of thingand it had transverse slope too and at this
end from front to rear which makes in somepart of regular and smooth slope in other
part regular by 3 to 4 steps Probably neededto be replaced every 5 years because this
maintenance was not being done at that timeand this is a very complicated structure and
why it was so that the Britishers could notunderstand but now people are saying it might
be due to know it will be creating secondaryflows which will making the silt to be not
settled down but suspended in the water
And that need to be researched and as I hadtold you earlier this over speed of about
3/4 inch thick of a very fine and smooth chunamis to prevent the water from making the smallest
impressions was need of the hour like thatmight be the reason and this plaster probably
needed to be replaced every 5 years As I hadtold you earlier this Grand Anikuts curved
form and the transverse and longitudinal slopeof its crest transported signification fraction
of bed sediments over the Anikut during thefloods that was the design what people are
anticipating okay it might be and it may bebecause if the flow is there there will be
secondary flows If the secondary flow is therethat means re circulation will be there and
that will make the silt to be suspended andit will be carried over from the Cauvery to
the Kollidam
In fact the first modification done in 1806AD around by British engineer was made to
level the top of the structure raise it byabout 2 feet and they were not understanding
they said let us raise the height and whichcreated problems of silt deposition and thus
you know then they could not find out Whatthey did over all bed slope from the point
of bifurcation Cauvery branch is increasedthere by increasing the speed of the flow
hence its sediments carrying the capacityand preventing any net aggradation Aggradation
means basically the rise of river bed dueto the deposition of sand they have done but
that is not working Degradation refers topicking up of sediments from the river earlier
it was doing the degradation it is the pickingthe silt and taking away
Now that was the design what we are havingLet me tell you that what are this grand what
you call Cotton later on cotton gave a statementhe says that this statement I had earlier
mentioned let me mentioned again It was fromthem the native Indians we learned how to
secure a foundation in the loose sand of unmeasureddepth In fact what we learned from them made
the difference between the financial successand failures for the Madras river irrigation
executed by our engineers have been from thefirst the greatest financial success of any
engineering works in the world surely becausewe learned from them them means native Indians
With this lesson about the foundation we builtbridges weirs aqueducts and every kind of
hydraulic work we are thus deeply indebtedto the native engineers So if you look at
this is the things that will be I will justsummarise this
That this is if you look at the Anikut facilitatesthe water during the draught and flood water
transfer to the Kollidam along with the siltwithout silt depositions right And the side
weir slope silt transfer to the Kollidam duringthe flood And uhh if you look at that means
if you summarise it the traditional automaticde silting which is very important and we
can learn from them and utilise in the modernsystem and drought water balance and weir
hydraulics is also very sophisticated andwhich need to be looked at Thank you very
much for looking at this lectures and we willstop over here and in the next lecture we
will be discussing about different aspectsof the irrigation system Thank you
