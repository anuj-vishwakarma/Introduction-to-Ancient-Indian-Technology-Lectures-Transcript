Let us start this lecture with a thought processCultivation is the method of realizing your
infinite potential lying dormant in you bydeveloping intimate relationship with Mother
Nature If you look at this thought I had alsomentioned earlier that if you want to be a
Rishi a sage you will have to do Krishi Rishibanne ke liye krishi karna zaroori hai
So let us recall that what we are learnt inthe last lecture We basically looked at sowing
methods and then we looked at transplantationshow to do that and what are the ways and why
we will do And we also discussed about themulching which is basically covering the soil
And why we will do and how we will do whatare the types All those things we learnt
And today we will be looking at basicallypesticides Pesticide you will be knowing that
you know the pest which will be affectingthe crop and basically insects fungus and
other things destroy the plants And thereforepesticide is basically pest killer And it
was a problem which was been identified earlieralso in our text or the literature that people
say that major calamities if you look at oneof them of course the insects but other calamities
what our ancestors had identified is the raincyclone drought and uhh rats you know rats
were you know also this thing Today also weface problem
And so also birds and parrots and foreigninvasions of course for the birds and parrots
and other things we are having a way to givethem something So that they will be also there
Because the birds are important for it isimportant for the like taking this uhh stigma
to other places right
And also the another thing is foreign invasionAnd today if you look at we are facing the
problem of cultural invasion okay Becauseour culture is being uhh getting spoiled at
very rapid rate And according to the AgniPuranas that is uhh it prescribes the few
treatment to the promote the growth of flowerfruits and overcome the infertility right
And after uhh actually they use in this processthey use lot of local materials And the organic
materials which is available like weed dungwhich I had shown you cow means desi ghee
and they should use this mixture and theyshould mixed with the cold water along with
the Kulatha Masha and Mudgha These are thekinds of grains what is being you know being
cultivated in our country and barley and sesamethis is basically Til And this has to be sprinkled
for the uhh as a pesticides
And not only that like uhh I remember thatin our place we used to have used the neem
right As a part of pesticides like And therewill be several others like Dhaatura and other
plants were used as a pesticide for uhh sothat you know it can prevent
And those are local knowledge are uhh youknow are being lost uhh now is being lost
already and we need to revive it and so thatpeople will be not depending on upon too much
on the chemical pesticides The natural pesticidecan be used
It recommends sprinkle with uhh sprinkle theplants with cow ghee and cold water as a general
remedy Now one to test of course cow gheeis very costly now who will use that We will
have to find it out what is the better cheaperway of doing that And powder of the ofal matter
of the sheep goats and other animals alsoOfal matter means you know internal matters
place which you people cannot consume andthe barley powders and again til til is very
much used and beef and this powder are keptburied for 7days underground like you know
And that might be for the fermentation orsome other thing why it is so that question
has to be asked Then that we sprinkle on theplants and this for the uhh as a which can
act as a pesticide Plants are to be irrigatedwith washing of fish of course this I know
because uhh when I was a kid my mother usedto put this uhh you know ofal maters of the
fish which cannot be taken as a food nearbyuhh what you call lemon tree which was not
giving the fruit But that tree had startedgiving I at least I can vouch for that because
I have seen in my childhood
So that was which was being used and it isthere in the text also I worm eaten plant
is to be irrigated with solution of oil cakeand water Earlier days oil cake being used
because oil
being produced in the village itself by theperson you know Each year during the harvest
season we produce our own oil and keep itand use it not buy from the market So that
is the things which we do not have today andthis is the weed dung I thought I will show
you
And it is a weed dung this thing an powerfulanti-parasitic herbs of Ayurveda which is
being used profusely Not only for the plantsfor also the human beings
And this is the til or the sesame which isbeing used Also for that you know if we will
use this oil on your hair you can grow goodhair and then you will not having problem
of itching and other things you know right
So there is a Kanda Karaand other insectsthis I have shown you some of the insects
what you know affect our plants And have tobe taken out from the roots Ok Of the tree
which then sprinkled with cold water for 7days I dont know why cold water how it will
affect these are question are coming to mymind and it might be coming to your mind for
that you need to do research and find it out
And for destroying the insect text recommendedadministrating the water containing milk and
carcass water-Kunapa is basically call againthe flees and other things it will be fermented
and it will be put it will be having lot ofsmell also right Kunapa and Bhillota dry and
Vaca Bhacha called basically bacha kind ofthings we call in and then cow dungs So this
has to be basically used for the destroyingthe insects
And by plastering of Siddhartha is anotherplant of the ant Vaca and Kustha Ativisa these
are all plants which you people may not beknowing even is a local in a Sanskrit names
and this can be used also for the as a actas a pesticide And you can fumigate fumigate
is burnt it and then the gas will be goingout with the fume of Siddhartha Ramatha Vidanga
I have shown you Usana and washing of beefsand horn of buffalos and flesh of pigeons
along with the powder of Bhillota
See there is a lot of things are there butone has to see which one is use where that
also part is part of the text but I am notmentioning here because of paucity of time
And another recommendation plaster Vidangawith mix the ghee irrigate with the alkaline
water for 7days That is also they were awarethat this can be done and poultice of the
beef Siddhartha and sesamum like this is againkind of these things which has to be used
And worm eaten plant is to be irrigated witha solution of oil cake in the water right
This is being used in earlier days and insectson leaves are destroyed by dusting them with
ashes brick dust and this I have used recentlyin my plants in the kitchen garden which is
quite useful right Particularly with ashesfrom the wood and some people use from the
cow dung ashes right
And injury caused by insects right To theplant can be healed by plastering Jantughna
and then sesame or cows urine ghee and ofcourse Siddhartha and watering with the milk
right And these are things are there whichis available locally and it can be used If
you look at we use basically cows and thenmilk and then urine and then other things
So therefore this is the thing which is beingused as a manure also you know cow dung and
other thing
So manuring is very important because evidenceabout is for manure goes back to the Vedic
period and because they used the term karisaand sakri sakam saka basically it is nothing
but cow dung you know
And cow dung is important that is why cowis considered as a very important for our
cultivation culture right What we our inheritedfrom our ancestors The word karisa the continues
the Sataptha Brahmana they know it is driedcow dung and cow dung was collected in a cow
stall according to Atharav Veda provide referencein mention of cow dung as a useful manure
of sally variety of rice It is a very youknow sort after rice and even during Vedic
period
And Arthsastra observed that the qualitiesof land is very important like and which is
has to be Krutham Krutham means basicallyis to be done it is not that you will get
okay You will have to contrive it you willhave to make it prepare it for that And ksetra-sodha
which is you know is important being mentionedin the Ramayana that means improving the field
and use of basically fertilizers or the manures
Of course now a days people are using chemicalfertilizer but there is a organic fertilizer
what we our ancestors were using And Krsi-Parasarayou might be aware I had mentioned
earlier that recognizes importance of manurefor crops and about the you know which is
important for getting a good yield right
And if you look at I have shown you like ahere a pit and which is containing cow dung
and this is known as basically pit compostinglike is having pit and you put that and it
will ferment and then you will get the compost
Arthasastra refers to treatment of seeds andapplication of manure to the soil and if you
look at most of all the scriptures are talkingabout the manuring or the use of manure for
the enhancing the fertility of the soil
And Kasyapiyakrsisukti if you look at thisis the text which is basically edited with
an introduction by study by Guyala WojtillaA Sanskrit word this is the largest work on
the agriculture This is a very thick bookand unfortunately it is not available now
what I was told but it is being done by theedited by the you know Guyala Wojtilla you
can see and which says that this is a veryadjustive you know book describing about various
aspects of agriculture in India Ancient India
And cultivator basically you know you willhave to use cow dung goat dung and composites
with you know to increase the fertility ofsoil that means you will have to use that
And it advises that paddy seedling had tobe transplanted in rice field softened by
ploughing that means first you do the ploughingand then you put this what you call seedling
Of course it should be manure with the goatdung cow dung with of course lata lata you
know basically is a creeper and vratati rightWhich will be going up this things has to
be done That means it is basically who canlook at it acts as a mulching also right
And according to this verse 513 it says thatit is desirable that second cultivation is
to be done after having raised the fertilityof soil by manuring with goat dung or cow
dung or composites of the mix of that becauseearlier days goats were being reared that
is why Gandhiji was very fond of goat milkright If you remember that this is because
if you want to have a second you know cultivationthen you will have to enhance this fertility
and once you do that with the growing populationparticularly
According to the text by the Cirabhati LambuKakaru and Trapasu other belonged category
of Saka Saka means basically pot-herbs youcan develop the herbs in a pot had to be fumigated
with a bone ordure and hog on Sunday I donot know why on Sunday why not other days
and to be burned by the straw fire in themonth of Phalguna See they are very particular
about the month and then of course maybe withthe seasonal thing
Sprinkle that with oil-cake mixed with thespirituous liquor you know liquor can be used
maybe for fermentation of this and then thatwill be something organic something will be
coming up which will be important to enhancethe fertility of the soil
And there are various kinds of fertility ofcourse now it has been improved little bit
That is a trench composting and if you lookat you can out this material organic matter
particularly cow dung goat dung even likeyour vegetables creepers some other thing
material which is can be made compost organicmatter
And then it will take time so that you canhave here you can feel here and then you can
this maybe working place you can joined hereand then once it is fill ad then prepared
for it you can put this plant And this isknown as trench composting and there are some
other varieties that is a anaerobic in naturethis is but whereas aerobic nature where air
will pass through this a compost basket kindof thing you put those organic matter for
the decompose But in this case some of thegas will be coming out which will be may be
polluting that atmosphere But here the gaswill not be because air is going through So
therefore this is being also you know is usednot only now a days but in earlier times also
even some villages people do that
They may not be aware it aerobic and anaerobicbut they know that this is the thing you know
to be done
So and as I told that cow is a part of ouryou know agriculture particularly in village
areas people do rear and even cities Why willrear cow you know is the question and why
our ancestor did it in ancient time Thereare several regions and of course most of
them you will be knowing one is the of coursewe use milk products profusely and other thing
is agriculture tilling irrigation cartingand other And transport for the transport
earlier days mostly it is done by the ox orOxen
And there is another important aspect whichis for a better physical and mental health
Physical because you will get the food andyou will be taking care of the cow and you
know do some physical work and also the takea nutritious food like their milk products
And mental health means you know like youwill have relationship with them and that
is the reason why know people are talkingabout animal therapy in western countries
and earlier it was a part of our life AndI have seen that you know people wherever
they are in a trouble they will go and havea chat with the cow as if you know there is
can listen and can understand the thing Andthat gives us all us because if you go and
tell your problem to some another person thatfellow may spread and you may encounter problem
but if you go and tell talk with a cow orsome other animal which you are having this
thing then you would not So that will givethings you know therefore this is the important
part what our ancestors were doing and weneed to do that if possible at this moment
also
So India today has around 37 pure cattle breedslot of breeds are being what you call extinct
because we are not taking care of them andthen and 5 of them 5 of these are more maybe
Sahiwal Gir Red Sindhi and Tharparkar Rathiare well known for milking powers it is more
than the Jersey or the Holstein the westernbreeds right Which is known for the milk production
And there is another varieties like KankrejOngole Hariana or belong to dual breeds that
have milch power like milk they can producemilk more Also the draught qualities that
means they are good for plough animals also
There are several these are the some of theyou know figures I am showing I will not go
into that this is a Panwara Nagori they arehaving each having their own name you know
That means that we are so attached to themstarted giving the name you know And it belongs
to various parts of the country because Indiais not a country it is a sub-continent I call
it you know So there are various regions arehaving So cow was very important and we should
preserve it for our life and so also cultivationand the local cow or the native cow is very
important
I will talking about little bit why what arethe difference between indigenous and the
foreign cattle breeds If you look at thisour indigenous breed they can tolerate the
heat as the sweat glands are bigger in sizeand more in number These are technical thing
you can see yourself
And sticky secretion smooth skin and shorthairs avoid insect pests And that is you will
see that because they are being grown herefor ages together Whereas the exotic foreign
cattles breeds like your Holstein or the Jerseyor some other breeds develop in the cold temperate
conditions and sweat glands are small andless in number so cannot tolerate high temperature
in our tropical climate
And you can see even today that in the summerthe cow will be you know making a vibration
moving here and there like that and they arefeeling pain because this is not the place
for them because the body is not designedfor that okay It is as were like a foreigner
will come and stay in the 45°C may be itsometimes goes to 48-49 you will feel like
fish out of water right Similarly the cowsare in pain also the western cows what we
are taking because of getting more milk
And Indians one is very active and diseaseresistance adjustability is quite excellent
and most of them are specially developed forhard work from centuries together you know
It is not that they are being used for ploughingother things and they are prone you know acclimatized
with this thing And more this exotic cattlebreeds are prone to disease cross breed bulls
are lazy in nature and not suitable for hardwork right
And if you look at the indigenous one is smallclosed is the hard hooves hooves means you
know in their leg or the palm is good forthe ploughing but whereas hove decays is less
here because when they will there will befriction and then it will be decaying It cannot
it can run on the hard rock rocky surfaceparticularly Himalayan cows can go also steep
they can climb the mountain you know Himalayancow if you look at I have seen myself and
which is very uncalled for we cannot as ahuman being climb but the cow can climb you
know like
And hooves is soft in case of exotic or thecattle breeds and gap between the hooves is
wide as a result it is you know cannot walkproperly it will be very slow and they get
also hove diseases It cannot run on the rockysurfaces cannot even walk forget about running
okay
And certain breeds produce good amount ofmilk of course some of them breeds produce
less amount of milk but we should also lookat the quality of the milk what we get and
which I am not discussing but you can lookat technicalities In case of exotic or cattle
or the foreign cattle breeds in case of foreigncattle breeds the Y chromosome of the bos
taurus is damaged
during the process of evolution leads to thedecrease of milk yield potential and high
fertility with the time right
And the teats and pores remains tightly closedecreasing the chances of mastitis but in
contrast if you look at the teats and poresare big hence milking is easy in case of foreign
cattle breeds but this is the reason for morechances of mastitis That means mastitis will
be getting they will be getting lot of painit because those pores will be blocked right
In case of exotic breeds but in case of indigenouscattle breeds it would not because they are
designed that way
And uterus opening in case of indigenous cattleremains closed which minimizes the infection
In contrast the foreign breeds that is theentry to the uterus inside the body remains
open so therefore it is subjected to the youknow maybe a infection very easily right
And vitamin A and iodine content in case ofindigenous cattle breed is more in milk and
bad cholesterol is less right The good cholesterolmaybe more I mean like that one has to see
But it is but in case of the foreign cattlebreed milk has more amount of bad cholesterol
therefore you will get more heart problemsand other things vitamin A is less
So therefore we need to look at that you knowindigenous cow is should be used for our application
of course the (exo) the foreign cattle canbe good for them but for us it may not be
because it is not acquainted with our notevolved in this part of the country So basic
principles of tradition natural agriculturelet me just talk about little bit about that
Traditional agriculture considered the animalscrops and soil as a single system it is not
different okay They are integrated and holisticapproach what we think and it emphasizes on
a local breeds and varieties that is why Ihave already talked about why we will go for
local or the native cow breeds And it advocatesuse of astrological sowing and planting calendar
of course I am having little reservation aboutthis astrological sowing
Although it may be used as a predictive toolaccording to one of my student who happens
to be engineer but he takes a lot of interestin this astrological but I do not have it
But that does not mean that you should notcheck it you can check it and find it out
whether it is true or not that has to be doneokay
And it uses various herbal mineral additivesfor compost preparation which is you know
natural and it advocates from the local productionand distribution system that is very important
because we will have to produce locally anddistribute so that transportation costs and
also the pollution due to the transportationcan be minimized
And people in one locality should not youknow remain hungry because food is not there
But now a days what is happening is good varietiesof let us apple will go away from Kashmir
and you know other people good varieties ofthe rice Saal suppose it is in Bihar now Bihari
people will not get that you know So thereforethat things goes because of this market system
and then we advocate on that the natural farming
It relies on the open pollination seeds inthe natural manner you know pollination is
very important therefore birds and other thingsthey do and insects you know like your butterflies
and other insects they help in pollinationSo that is a very important thing which we
need to take care because now a days peopleare thinking to use artificial pollination
because pollination is being reduced now adays because of the air pollution and water
pollution lot of insects are dying and whichis very important Therefore it is very important
to look at that
And advantages of natural farming The farmingcost can be reduced considerably right We
are talking about a zero budget farming thatmeans you need not to pay any money you can
do you can integrate it in such a way thatone can have zero budget farming So that you
know the farmer would not die because of indebtbecause they have taken lot of loans and then
they could not repay because of you know calamitiesSo that has to be looked at in ancient days
it was all integrated right
And the eliminate we will have to by thisnatural farming we can eliminate use of synthetic
or the chemical fertilizers and pesticidewhich is not only you know bad for our health
but for the mankind And it minimizes soilerosion as I had explained earlier increasing
the crops yield up to two-fold within 5 yearsbecause the soil is already being you know
spoiled by the use of chemical fertilizerit will take time to come up so and then free
from harmful chemicals artificial flavourand preservatives right
And we do all these things for our you knowwhat you call food industries that is another
big problem challenge for the people to havea good health And eating natural foods may
in fact reduce the risk of heart attacks strokesand cancers as I had mentioned earlier nd
if we use the native things and then you knowit will be really you can overcome lot of
problems to a larger extent
So if you look at the natural farming is basicallyfor the Mother Nature it is the related and
you can think of there will be environmentrestoration right Because if we use it there
will be environmental restoration means environmentcan become better if you would not pollute
their water air and other things also soiland poly-culture and bio-diversity is important
for the nature to work right And we as I toldthat inter-cropping is nothing but way of
poly-culture right Together you are doingsymbiotic relationship developed
Efficient use of natural resources we aretalking about because if we use local you
need not to really spoil it and restores trustin society because today because of food and
because of business the trust among the peopleare you now being reducing at alarming rate
trust is important So therefore we can restorethe trust in the society trust is important
for any relationship
And billion of innocent people are dying becauseof food and that culture has to be that nobody
should die without food ad that humanity hasto come up when you go for the natural path
And recession of proof of local job creationsustainable manner you are going for job but
agriculture will give a lot of job securityright Food is important anyway you are working
hard to get the food and the food is whatyou are getting is junk or is not of good
quality So you can do means you will get thegood food right
And decentralized food system what I had alreadydiscussed urban natural way see earlier days
people say that the villagers will you knowmake the cultivate the and feed the urban
people I say no you should convert the urbanareas to the you know the village urban areas
in ancient India nothing but a larger villageright And they should cultivate their own
food
And community supported organic agricultureor the natural agriculture is important community
together will be doing not individual foodsecurity and safety And health
prevention through proper diet as I told andas I told earlier that health we need to spend
that much of money
And if you look at there is a climate stabilizeby carbon captures it can be done And food
and clean water for all because what happenthe water you are not contaminating because
of adding chemicals and then using the urbanwaste and outing into rivers lot of problem
can be solved and if you do all those thingsnatural farming can give you the world peace
according to me because the peace is beinghampered because of you know you are greedy
and you are trying to encroaching into othersareas
So concluding remark let me tell you nutritiousand natural food is essential for not only
human beings for other animals also rightThat is important keep in mind Man has not
created forests rivers mountains brooks etcbut destroyed them in the name of development
with the help of modern science and technologyAnd natural farming practiced by ancestors
is the panacea to the modern human being owesas I told in the last you know as I told earlier
And more research should be carried out toadopt the traditional agriculture technology
to re-establish the umbilical relationshipwith Mother Nature You know when you are in
a womb there is a pipeline which comes toyou for feeding from the mother okay So that
umbilical relationship is required leadingto the restoration natural balance in our
ecosystem which is at stake which is in troubletoday
And native agriculture technology should bepreserved and improved further not that you
know you through it out as being done todayand native seed banks should be created for
preservation of native breeds not that youwill have to depend on the multinational companies
or companies to have your own seed we shouldhave seed varieties and then we should have
a you know of our own So this is very importantpoint you should keep in mind that will affect
because that is affecting entire life foodis important So therefore I will with this
I will stop over and I hope that and wishthat you should learn something from it and
apply in your life Thank you very much
