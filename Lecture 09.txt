Let us start this lecture uhh by recallingwhat we had learnt in the last few lecture
I had a given introduction to the AncientIndian Science and Technology And I am trying
to impress upon you people that we had a verygood heritage of the ancient uhh there is
a very good heritage of the scientist thescientific heritage We are having And we should
try to learn and also address the problemsfaced by the modern science and technology
due to the wrong philosophy of life and alsothe philosophy of science and technology is
against the Mother Nature
And I had given a where we can intervene whatwe can learn and from the uhh Earlier Indian
science and technology so that we can uhhwhat you call look at it a new perspective
and also adapt in the modern day And todaywe will be looking at agriculture
Therefore let us start with the thought processThat is Agriculture is the Foundation of Human
Civilization If you look at like uhh thatuhh we are being told that people were living
in the jungles like animals particularly theman But later on they learnt how to cultivate
and they settle and then civilization startThat is the fulcrum or that is the starting
point of human civilization Therefore agricultureplays a important role And if you look at
our scriptures that agriculture is very importantBecause “Anna Parishta Devaa" Even the god
has to rely on the food So food is very important
And what will be looking at here in this whatare the technology available in ancient India
Particularly pertaining to the agriculturemeans farming And we will have to see how
we can adopt it is But before that we needto ask certain question Why do we give importance
for agriculture in India
Since time in memorial I mean see if you goback to the even like starting of the civilization
in this country which is around what we havelooked at historically like 8000 before the
common era kind of things So therefore whycan anybody tell me Like why we need to give
that much importance to agriculture Why notwill be on service sector or some manufacturing
kind of things
STUDENT: Because food is the basic need
PROFESSOR: Yes
STUDENT: So it has to
PROFESSOR: (Interrupts) we can always youknow import I mean there are several other
countries who rely on import of food at thismoment Why we cannot Any idea And we will
have to see what are the you know the landWhat kind of land we are having What are the
natural resources we are having And how thosethings are conducive for cultivation So that
we will be looking at Because I have alreadydiscussed some of the things
I am repeating because you have not kept inmind That is why I was thinking that repeating
it India has 52%age of cultivable land Ascompared to the world average You can say
that it is the what you call food house ofthe world That means she is having or the
India if I say as a mother you knowlike alwayswe say Mother India So she has the you know
that capability to produce the food Provideus food And food is important
Beside this for the cultivation or any plantationor trees we rely upon the sunshine Because
that is the energy being captured by the allfauna you know or the plants Because that
way energy is converted into you know throughphotosynthesis And then we use it for our
energy need of the body Ok Because if youlook at whole this thing is energy only Right
Energy and what you call information Thatis the main thing what we do sustain the life
And so also the other things So sunshine isvery important And this we are endowed with
that Being a being in a semi-tropical regionAnd we also climate is very important for
cultivation So we are having something 15major climate region Therefore varieties of
the plants we can having The biodiversityis quite you know phenomenal in this case
10 bio-diversity regions are in this countryAs I told earlier India is not a country it
is a sub-continent Ok
It is not a mere country Because of bio-diversityBecause of this various major climate regions
and we are having endowed with a lot of alsofauna and floras Of course this number I have
little bit changed than the earlier one Thatis over 871318 species of fauna we are having
So it is quite a big number Of course dueto the human interventions and due to the
uhh what you call abuse and misuse of themodern science and technology in the name
of developments
Adapting the unsustainable and uhh what youcall anti-nature mother nature we are spoiling
it And we should keep because the life allare connected That is the our scripture always
talk about And similarly 47000 species offlora found in India and there might be much
more than that And of course I will show youthat this I have taken from some resources
Because the number I was doubting so thenI found out look that this taken from reference
I will show you little bit later on
And India has a largest livestock populationswhich is you know uhh quite good for our need
to the milk and then you know other kind ofthings like as a food also Even I will let
you why we need to rear the animals is veryimportant Right I will be talking about later
on that let me ask you a question “thatwhy we need to have livestocks” Why we need
it for our life Why not we use machines Whatare the advantages What are the disadvantages
Please think about it Can anybody tell menow Why we need to have livestock
STUDENT: Natural
PROFESSOR: Huh
STUDENT: Natural
PROFESSOR: But that cannot be part of Thenhow it is related to the life And how Why
not have a machine For example I can havea tractor I can have a trailer I can have
some other things they will do Why we willhave a life Because is this you know So those
question you need to ask and I am having somelogic to it And we can discuss later on
And large number of rivers and water bodiesYou know if you look at the so many rivers
are there Like you start from Ganga BrahmaputraKaveri- these are big rivers Mahanadi Tapti
Godaveri Krishna there are several riversif you name you know it will be too many Right
(laughs) These are the big rivers I am talkingabout There are several uhh small rivers are
there in this country Not only that we arehaving lot of water bodies Lakes are spanning
over kilometres
We are having also uhh unfortunately in moderntimes we are encroaching into the their portion
and taking for our habitats and kind of whichis bad Because of growing populations And
also not concerned for the nature That isthe very important So uhh if you look at I
was talking about I have taken this data (slideshown) Alfred Gearbe written by the Overview
and Fauna Diversity in India And uhh of courseas I told Alfred Gearbe and others also And
this is from NV Centre Zoological Survey 1998This is little old data But however this numbers
will be correct to whatever I am quoting
So that is the reason you know one of theI am uhh the reason why we should go for cultivation
Because we are teaming population of 130 croreI am mean you can say 125 crore by official
But actually according to me it will be around130 crore people Right And we cannot rely
on the outside country to for their food Wewill be in trouble
And why is the agriculture important for Indiaas I told that even today the livelihood of
the people 130 crore people you know 53% somethingbeing provided by the agriculture Although
in spite of that still we are finding difficultiesto having you know labourer for the agriculture
That is the problem today we are facing inthe village area rural areas or the villages
And this is accounts for 16% of GDP
Let me tell you it has been lowered down Becauseof fact that services are increasing I will
show you a diagram maybe It will be uhh tellyou (Slide shown) if you look at agriculture
was highest in the 1950 Something 50% of GDPwas from agriculture And in industries was
something around maybe 18% roughly you knowif you look at this diagram Then it goes up
and then you know goes uhh up and then ofcourse now it is going up little bit It is
data is till 12th no 2010 you know 16% maybelittle higher because lot of importance given
for manufacturing with the new governmentin the centre
And the of course the service sectors hasbeen increasing at rapid rate But it can fall
at any time because we are depending on theforeign countries for that Because we became
a service provider for the most of the westerncountries in software particularly So it will
fall down where will go right that is theone question we need to ask And food is important
Of course agriculture GDP is going down Butwe need to take care of our own food security
So uhh if you look at uhh that contributionof total export we do export lot of food stuff
to other countries around 10% and suppliesraw materials to industries
For the other foreign countries I feel thatwhat we need to do that we need not to supply
the raw material Rather process it and goso that we can have value addition to that
And for that we need to have our own enterpriseswill do that Ok And in modern time particularly
lot of multi-national companies are comingand then they are doing business and we became
a you know what you call uhh uhh consumersand also we are going and doing a job
I will call upon of you all of you to becomeentrepreneurs And generate you know uhh value
added products and then sell like we can sellto other countries and become richer and then
get gain something you know wealth for ourown country and for our own sake So therefore
we need not to be a job seeker we should bejob provider That should you should be keep
in mind And lot of things we can do that
And growth rate in agriculture productionof course 5.7% this data is from 2000 you
can say 2010 or 2011 and 2012 kind of thingAnd food grain production is something 252.56
million tonnes It is in 2011-2012 Now it mighthave gone up a bit This that I you know I
have giving to have a feel that what we arehaving you know like and what is the potential
and how we can grow and other things and whywill go for agriculture That is the thing
to make a point You need not to worry aboutuhh you know about like exact data but you
can see the exact data
And if you look at total geographical areawhat we are having is 329 mega hectares And
potential for biological products to 65 megahectares Net sown area is 143 mega hectares
We can have also increase this land And netirrigated area is very small that is 56mega
hectares Area threatened by land degradations50% of this TGA what is the agrarian Because
of wrong method of cultivation and also theindustrializations you know our soil is being
getting spoiled And of course the droughtprone area is 190 mega hectares
But what I am thinking that it can be changedprovided if we have a relations develop a
relationship with them mother nature uhh Imean if we make our system integrated and
sustainable then we won’t have this problemWe can manage well These are all according
to me drought prone area is a rather man-madeIn other words if we understand the nature
and work with her to do that thing then youknow will don’t have that As you go along
will be discussing as I will be talking aboutthe natural farming toward the end of the
series of lecture on agriculture Right Souhh therefore the agriculture plays a major
role not only in economy but also that isthe foundation of national life
So it is very important that we need to stickto our agriculture and use our technology
I mean like whichever we can have get fromour ancient practices or traditional practices
And then do that
So before getting into that let us lok atwhat are the process involve uhh during this
farming You want to have like let us say youwant to grow rice wheat or paddy or any other
things And take it as a profession or a thisthing for our own What are the things we need
to look at it Can anybody tell me Like
STUDENT: Selection of soil
PROFESSOR: Yes selection of soil Any otherthing
STUDENT: Seed selection
PROFESSOR: Seed selection very good What elseHuh What are the resources Soil is very important
That means you need to identify the soil whatyou are having How to improve it What else
Any other thing
STUDENT: Availability of water resources
PROFESSOR: Yes Water how to you will get forirrigation or something Any other things If
you want to farmer you will have to look at8 major steps for you know crop selection
to the harvesting Because what kind of cropyou will have to do today we are all being
swayed away by the profit Rather I call profit-maniacyou know is being coming into pictures
But if you look at your uhh tradition it isnot the profit alone You will have to have
profit It is not that you will do with theloss Ok But it should be attached to the auspicious
thing You know I ask you in your all "auspiciousoccasion we write “Subh Labh” Why it is
so Why not only profit Labh means profit Whynot only profit Profit cannot stand of its
own Only for profit we should not live a life
We should not do anything Only for profitno It should be always will be auspicious
means will be integrated with do good to theothers to the society Right That is very important
That is our culture But we have forgottenWe are just writing on maybe this marriage
occasion or some other celebration traditionalcelebrations We write down we do not know
why we are writing Are you getting my pointSo it is very important to look that the signatures
which are there till now we are having butit is going it is you know being driven out
of our mind and also our traditions
Due to this blatant adoption of the westernway of life Right And we should understand
that this is the legacy what we are havingThis is the heritage which we have inherited
And we and it is very important to have profitbut it must be proper It must be for the welfare
of the society It must be welfare of the MotherNature All integrated Those are things So
therefore profit is required
So therefore you will have to select the cropWhen you select the crop how will have to
do that Will have to see what are the cropscan the soil we can have And what are the
your need For example you need food RightI should not do this what I call tobacco cultivation
Because I want money fast money Right Of coursetobacco is required for certain thing But
it should not make it like uhh what you call“nasha” Right Addiction And then all people
will be you are getting money but the societyis into turmoil Are you getting
So those things one has to look at it Buttobacco is having also effect on this some
Ayurvedic medicine or some other thing Thatis alright Are you getting my point So therefore
it is important to lok at what you want Ishould be ethical It should be societal benefits
One has to do that And the land preparationFor example you are having a land where you
want to have rice But it is not very suitableWhat you will have to do You will have to
prepare And you will prepare what are thethings And how you will do it naturally without
really spoiling
And seed selection How will you select a seedis very important Now a day’s seeds are
coming that companies are coming with a seedWhich will not having you know uhh kind of
thing it won’t germinate Even if you produceseed Sometimes seedless things are coming
now you know They are controlling we do nothave to the knowledge How to keep it how to
select it how to you know take care of itWhich see will have to select and how it will
be integrated with the uhh local areas
And seed sowing You will have to sow it Howto sow it properly so that it won’t get
affected Which time will have to do And thenwhat is that thing you will have to look at
it And irrigation as you told some of youtold water is very important Because our shastra
says “Anath Bhavantibhutani parjaynathaanashambh”That means from the rain water or the water
you know the aana means the food will come“Anathbhavantibhutani” that means from
what you call food the life has come Bhutanimeans living beings Ok
Therefore you will have to look at water Howto take care of it and what are the areas
And how to protect the waters so that it won’tbe taken away by the sun You know it will
evaporate and go And then you will have topreserve it How you will do that How will
integrate Then what is the crop growth RightThe growth how it is How will enhance Of course
you need to have how you will protect so thatgrowth can be done
And then fertilizing like you will have touse some fertilizers What kind of fertilizers
Whether you can do it naturally without usingfertilizer All those things you need to look
at it And harvesting How you will do Thatis the so you know key factors If you look
at harvesting is a very very important ifyou look at that the plants They grow themselves
We need not to do anything Is it will haveto do except will have to take care you know
like things are in proper this thing Otherwisethey grow of their own Provided sun shines
shade is not being shade You know shade isnot there or the sun is there Proper you know
these thing will be there So uhh and the soilwill be proper
And like animals and other things are preyor other things should not spoil So those
things you will have to look at So these arethe processes general process I have told
So that you will be you know familiar withwhat are the things to be done in agriculture
Because most of you may not have idea aboutthe agriculture Right Am I right So therefore
I have given some uhh introduction So willnow see I am let us ask a question what do
you mean by modern agriculture
Any idea in modern time we are adopting basicallyagriculture as an industry People are trying
to as if it is an industry It is there basicallybusinessyou know Earlier day’s people used
to do for their own food productions or foodtheir need And then there are using it in
a village kind of things But in modern timeit is an industry Right Right In awestern
country it is an industry almost Very richpeople will be farmer
Not like in our country where poor fellowwill be farmer Right Here poor fellow And
that is that is I am afraid that within maybe 50-60yrs the same thing will be there The
food will be controlled by the rich peopleAnd they will dictate what are the prices
will be And the poor fellow will be labourersNot there farmers Right And farming is very
important You want to grow spiritually youwill have to do farming Because I call “Rishi
banne ke liye Krishi karna zarrori hai”Right
So therefore it is important but what arethe problem is what is modern agriculture
So if you look at modern agriculture you justbasically hybrid seeds of single crop varieties
Right They use hybrid seeds or technologicallyadvanced equipment like tractors trailers
shedders rice transplanter and fertilizerspreaders You know lot of things gadgets you
will have to use And fertilizer pesticidesand water
Like you know by the modern irrigation systemTo produce large amount of single crop If
you look at even in India today rice onlyrice are there You know only wheat are there
So that is not really right thing Becauseyou look at nature if you go to a jungle what
do you see Is it that only this will be thereonly one crop one plant will be there No altogether
So therefore the togetherness is very importantRight
So nature works in that way If you look atanimal will be there insect will be there
and that plants will be there together inthe nature So similarly plant kingdom also
like that So but where in the modern you wantto have so therefore you this thing So and
you use this various gadgets And as a resultthe energy cost you use a lot of energy Energy
means you know like basically fossil fuelWe use for getting energy And then ploughing
for ploughing will be using the tractors foryou know like a ploughing Earlier day’s
we used to have a bullock for that and witha plougher But today mechanized one you can
do that And then you can use them harrowing
Harrowing may some kind of uhh making thisuhh soil to be conditions Or you can make
it break the soils and then you know alsomake this kind of what you call so that it
will be smaller one and air can get into allthose things that is there If you look at
this is the harrowing some kind of a pin willbe there and that will be You will have to
also planting you know Right you know youwill have to plant and you need to have fence
this things
And weeding out suppose some other thingsother you know plants will be growing because
of some unnecessary this thing that will takeaway you’re what you call fertilizer what
you are using You know then you will removeit But those may be beneficials you know you
do not know And then pest controls And ofcourse how to store this food that is also
another because we use air conditioner andother things You know lot of energy is required
That is result the cost is very high So whatI am thinking I will give an assignment maybe
to look at what are the cost involved Howthis cost is increasing day by day of the
food price
The production who to while cultivation youknow the farming cost is increasing Right
And where we are the coster so that we canminimize it And in India we don’t need really
big machines Because we are having a lot ofpeople and then they can work manually or
little bit small machine they can use whichis not consuming the or guzzling the you know
what you call energy either electricity orthe diesel or the petrol kid of things or
any other fuel So that we can and also oncethey will work they will get also physically
fit They need not to go for a walk or fora run and then do that thing for maintaining
the body These are all wrong notion that thereforeone has to use that thing
And uhh if you look at characteristics ofmodern agriculture (slide shown) it has higher
level of input Because you are giving a lotof energy or lot of costing is involved we
give lot of buy this aa Pesticides You willhave to buy this fungicide we will have to
buy this fertilizers will have to buy theseed also Right You will have to use this
all this gadgets from the market And outputper unit agriculture they want to have higher
But unfortunately it is not Therefore lotof farmers are committing suicide
It has a low fallow ratio Fallow means youknow this thing for cultivator so that you
know like less number of people will be requiredBecause they are using machine and higher
use of inputs such as capital labour higherfertilizer I have told pesticides And plant
got regulator They want to regulate controlit artificially And mechanization of higher
crop yields per unit land They want to havebut then they will have to pay the price for
it Cost is increasing
Demands more detail analysis of growing conditionincluding weather soil water weeds pest and
you know all this modern technology we areusing to predict it So that they will be and
then as a result what is happening peopledon’t have a feel for it There now farmers
are now labourers or farmers are dumb fellowsThey don’t have understanding what is happening
And realize on-going innovation agriculturemachinery farming methods genetic technologies
techniques for the achieving economic sub-scalelogistics
Even data collections analysis technologyyou know lot of sophistication has come up
And then that also for that you will haveto pay price Ok Which is natural one and we
are doing it unnaturally we are paying a lotof price for that So that is the problem with
as a result you know it is very costly affairsSo what will say that will stop over here
and we have seen that what is the what youmean by the agriculture And what are the processes
involve in agriculture And then will we alsolooked at why we need to go for agriculture
in our country And we have also seen whatis the methodology adopted for modern agriculture
and what are the fallacies Right Will stopover here Thank you
