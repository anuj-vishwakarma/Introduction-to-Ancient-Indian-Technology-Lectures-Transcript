Let us start discussion on ancient Indianrural housing and if you recall that in earlier
lectures we had discussed about basic needsthat is your agriculture and also textile
And let us start this lecture with a thoughtprocess from Mahatma Ghandi who says I do
not want my house to be walled in on all sidesand my windows to be stuffed I want the culture
of all lands to be blown about my house asfreely as possible but I refused to be blown
off my feet by any It is very important thatwe should learn from others as our Veda says
but at the same time we must retain the fundamentalsof our culture heritage and scientific tradition
And uhh let us look at about housing in ancientIndia
Some of the questions might be arising inyour mind what are the purpose of house Of
course most of you know that it is basicallyprotection against the weather and in recent
time there is a lot of climate changes sowe will have to look at this And besides these
animals insects creatures and you know whichare harmful for human life and property we
will have to protect also and the theft ofcourse safe storage is very important and
that is the characteristics of modern humanbeing if you recall that uhh or if you go
back to our history the theft was almost notthere in this country Even today in some villages
are without any door and lock particularlyin Maharashtra region and besides these we
will have to also protect ourselves againstthe natural calamities like flood cyclone
earth quakes and other things
So apart from that people do rear the cattleand other animals and we need to also store
there not only the agricultural products butalso other accessories or items of day to
day uses And considering you know ancientIndian culture we need to look at what are
the houses what we are having generally therural houses are detached from all four sides
And not always true but if you see uhh atleast in 50 years back or maybe earlier that
most of the houses were having separated outdue to several reason one of them of course
privacy other is ventilation but privacy isa new concept it was not there earlier in
our culture But what I feel that it mightbe that people were having lot of lands that
is one and other thing is that they were usingthatched house
So for higher safety they might have keptthe house separated little bit and beside
this they will be having a lot of land aroundfor cultivation and boundary wall were made
earlier days by mud wall or a low tree orshrub fences what we call hedge and even some
house you may find that it is not withoutany boundary because there will be land where
they will be cultivating so in front of theyard a plant of tulsi was kept particularly
in Hindu tradition and because we revere thetulsi plant And in the backwards even in front
also sometimes there are vegetable and herbalgarden as well as seasonal fruit trees which
are a part of rural housing earlier days andtrees like Asoka neem mango etc are kept around
the house and there are various reasons
It can also help to thwart the wind particularlyin cyclone time and of course it can maybe
sometimes fall on the house itself but itwill give resistance and Vaastu in traditional
Hindu system of architecture which was verymuch there and today it had evolved in rather
it has (reg) rejuvenated in a different formAlthough it is attached with lot of superstitious
but if you look at the scientific part itis quite interesting One can look at it which
I will not be covering but I am just mentioningit here for you people to explore it and find
out whether what are the right thing withthat And this Vaastu which is a Hindu system
of architecture helps to intricate the architecturewith the mother nature and which encompasses
a flexible design guidelines not only forthe space sun light flow and also its functionality
So therefore it is important to look at butI am not going to cover that here
And as I told Tulsi is very important andit is being placed in the front and also the
backyard of the house And I have just shownyou they do revere and make a lot of pujas
and other things Besides it creates a positiveenergy what people say because we are having
belief system and Ayurvedas best herb afterAmrit and it has been proven scientifically
Tulsi is you know medicinal very great medicinalplant and it is a sure solution for cough
and cold in human body I have tried becauselast 3 4 years I am experimenting with myself
and I have not taken any anti biotic medicineand whenever I am having cough and cold due
to the seasonal variation I just resort tothe tulsi and it is a cure for several other
diseases as I learned from the Ayurvedic bookso one has to look at it so it is very important
that should be a part of our house
Besides this you know Indian tradition isto welcome the guest Athithi Devo bhava And
we always welcome the people of outside andthen thing thing and if you look at you will
find there are several signatures of our civilizationI have just shown here which is some of them
you place in your home like Athithi devo orShub labh Labh means basically profit Subh
is auspicious then only profit will be thisis the signature of Indus valley civilisation
It is Not that we will get away by the profitalone it must be beneficial for the man kind
then the profit is good so besides this thereis a Yantra which is shown here in this place
and which is having a lot of importance relatedto our culture and heritage particularly in
tantric systems it is a lot of importanceis there I am not going to discuss about it
So these two are basically the feet impressionof the newly married bride who enters the
house because we consider them Lakshmi andthat is the symbol we welcome the bride to
our house and we also keep it in our mind
There is another important symbol what wekeep in front of our house is the swastika
chihn and it is having a lot of importancenot only psychologically but also the religiously
therefore that is the things one has to keepit and of course there are several ways people
are having There will be painting variouspaintings uhh we keep and tradition because
this brings happiness and pleasant environmentin the house and this kind of symbols what
we use as a part of you know our culture andsome of the goddesses and other things that
brings positive energy inside the house whichis very important so why we need to look at
and rethink about ancient Indian housing
If you look at today due to the cultural invasionand globalisation and marketization of our
life what we are losing the cultural heritageof across our country and particularly in
the as a result the local housing is not thereall are replaced with the same concrete and
mortar building structure Earlier days ifyou look at from Kashmir to the Kanyakumari
each state or each place will be having theirown tradition of making houses which are depending
on their weather condition depending on theirculture and other thing today it is not the
case So as I told modernisation is reallythrowing all our cultural way of designing
and developing the house from our life andwe are just copying and pasting and just forgetting
about our traditional knowledge which wasthere for together and it is just going to
dust bin
And we do not have a documentation for thatthat is very important and I must ask people
whoever is having you know having some interestin this they should document the way of making
not only the house but also the other traditionso that at least it will be retained And besides
this most of the houses today are not ventilatedproperly they are all sandwiched between two
houses and not many thing and it is not hygienicto a larger extend let me tell you Particularly
in rural areas where people are not that educatedand not that wealthy to afford to that for
a better construction of house Unhygienicand less or non ventilated house a I told
and various problems related to the housethey are facing today in rural areas for example
privacy neighbourhood feeling that is beingreceding in rural area which was the hall
mark of our rural life rather Indian life
And there is very low mentality of the peoplenowadays not sharing and then caring of the
people and cost of land is increasing andso also encroachment and local land policies
is a is in doldrums is in trouble So thereforethey are facing serious problems and Indian
native architecture is almost on the vergeof extinction So that is very important we
need to and those are developed over the yearsby our you know forefathers and we need to
re look at it
I am not saying we should copy and use thattoday but the fundamentals or the basics should
be retained And the other characteristicsof ancient Indian housing are major material
used in house construction in rural areaswere locally available so then transportation
cost and then other cost will be reduced andit is they are aware about it And today people
are not aware about whatever things are availablein their areas but they are they may be getting
from outside that is the fallacy of the presentsystem And construction technique was as simple
as possible so that the knowledge was withthe local people and they were also learning
from generation to generation passing thatknowledge to others
Person living could construct repair maintainit by themselves they feel good about it They
feel that they have built the house not theworkers and local architecture cultural heritage
were maintained and good health of the residentwhich was considered the prime important for
making a house but today it is not And positiveenergy creation in the house were also a part
of this thing which was emphasised in Vaastusystem and spirituality and attachment in
the family because when you do together andyou own that house own means literally owning
not owning only from investing money and thenmaking a house But you feel that I have made
this and that part attachment is importantand which is important that values of human
life were preserved which is at stake todaySo that is the things we need to therefore
we need to look at our ancient Indian wayof making house and maintaining house
So if you look at major components of ancientIndian house are basically floor wall and
roof of course here I have shown you somethingabout that This is your roof and these are
the walls of course the floor is here whichis you know you can say veranda kind of thing
So rural materials house basically metal stoneand bricks of course bricks you can make yourself
not to buy I remember that when I was a kidthat local people were knowing how to make
brick but today if I go back to the same placewhere I had learned how to make brick in my
childhood today they do not know how to makeand they buy that from factories and mud which
is plenty in available and wood bamboo andagricultural waste were being used for making
houses and which was basically suitable eventhe brick to some extend sustainable
Of course stone is not sustainable and sotoday what we use are not sustainable and
earlier days house were sustainable Let ussee that you know like what do we mean by
mud because uhh today we are not aware aboutthe mud earlier days mud was a part of life
not only agriculture for making housing andhaving pond and then several other things
It is a part and parcel of our life So mudis a basically a mixture of different kinds
of soil It can be Loam it can be silt it canbe clay of course you will have to add some
water kind of things and when you say it isa mud brick basically we call mud brick which
is not baked of course today we are usingbaked mud brick and when it is not baked it
is known as adobe and it can be made by mixingmud with water and placing this mixture into
a mould Like for example here this is themould and in which this will be the mud will
be packed and then it will be getting theshape of the mould particular shape and then
allowing it to dry in open air with the helpof of course sun drying
And people do add the straw and some kindof rice husk and other things and straw is
used as a binder within the brick as it alsosupports to the lattice because whenever a
brick is subjected to a force the straw willredistribute the force throughout the brick
and decreasing the chance of breakage Andthese are traditionally being used and that
also similarly saw dust and other agriculturalwaste being added to the mud also for making
brick So this is a house which is made outof mud not only the wall also the roof in
Punjab even still in some places it is beingused
And of course this is a pakka house and thereis a kacha house also Like this is basically
a mud wall and this is a thatched basicallythatched roof but here the roof is flat and
also it is made of mud kind of thing so wewe will be discussing about it Why do we use
mud for construction of house Because it iseasily available for community participation
and used by (unsil) unskilled labour If youlook at earlier days in the rural areas we
are having ponds for maintaining ponds youneed to sometimes remove them what you call
mud from the pond and those mud generallywere taken by people who wants to make the
construct the house And it is a very totalsystem cycle was there and it is beautifully
narrated in several places kind of thingsBut unfortunately today the pond is not there
and even the mud from the bottom of the pondis used for the field for agriculture purposes
And it is this adobe or the sun dried brickedare easy for cutting and turning or adjusting
the dimension of mud brick like the otherone which is little difficult but you can
use also that is the baked mud and no energyis required for making the mud brick mud brick
means I am talking about the adobe right Asthe solar energy is used for drying and cost
wise it is you know like a lot of saving almost40 percent cost as compared to the brick And
uhh the use of mud in building a good acousticand insulation it is basically gives a very
good insulation so the temperature will belowered down unlike the concrete which will
absorb the heat and then (()) (1900) And thermalinsulation area and act as a domestic air
condition conditioner kind of thing and hencesuitable for tropical and sub tropical like
areas like in India
India today people are using glasses for thewindow pane and then other brick and of course
the mortars and cement they are using Earlierdays we were using lime or the mud which is
a better material as compared to mortar andcement today and self sustainable and eco
friendly because it is eco friendly you neednot make anything to you know burn the fuel
or something to do that So therefore it isvery important to use mud and mud is a part
of our culture and we always revere it asa part of our rituals So if you look at the
thermal design of a rural house and you canthink of like this is a roof of course this
is made of mud right mud wall and the roofis thatched house that is roof and there is
a overhang here
This is a wall and this is a overhang nowwhy this overhang is there why not it will
just end wherever the wall is getting endedAnd it is having because it will protect the
wall and other regions from the heating ofthe thermal particularly in summer Not only
that when you are using the mud wall and youare using adobe the sun dried mud brick then
you will have to take care that water shouldnot fall it will damage it so that is another
reason So let us look at thermal side andwhen you look at lets say we will talk about
summer which is June 21 the sun path willbe from east this side it will be going Of
course this is the middle of the day and thenit will be coming down
And in December it will be just in the theangle will be different and it will be here
somewhere and if you look at shadow wise itwill be changing Of course this is the east
side keep in mind This is your east side andthis is your west Similarly this is your north
and this is your south Now if you look atJune 21 is the midsummer hence construction
of the overhangs or the evaes what I toldthis is the overhangs helps to obstruct the
summer sun rays but in winter due to inclinedsun the sun is ay different smaller angle
it does not obstruct the Sun rays to keepthe house warm That means in the summer it
will protect the house from the sun rays sothat it will not really heat it up But in
the winter it will allow the sun rays to enterinto the house and keep it warm what a beautiful
design it is right But today we are makinghouse we are not thinking about it right
This is the same figure I am just doing ifyou just rotate that inclined roof if I will
put house by 90 degree like this if I saythis is your east here right and this is your
west my house will be you know doors are tothe south right and of course the windows
and other things will be north side and theeast and west side If you do that morning
sun will come in eastward inclination rightand evening sun will come to the west side
it will come morning here you know and morein from the east and then it will go to the
west that is the normal thing in the summerand winter will be like that way So that what
will happen if you look at you know the ofcourse this is taken for the 40 degree latitude
right that is corresponding to Indian conditionof course it will vary from you know region
to region the angle But let us consider thisangle so June 21st the sun ray will come directly
here and it will heat the plinth area
Then you know your wall is not affected bythe sun rays And provided these overhangs
is here right But suppose it could not havebeen there then it would have fallen here
whole building it could have But in the winterwhat happens this rays is having different
angles that is 266 degree kind of thing sothen it will enter inside and it will warm
See that is the beauty of the design right
And this of course depends on what is thelength you will have to give this length And
this length is very important and they havedeveloped that thing over the years of course
it will be varying from region to region Itis not that they are knowing that precisely
at that time I guess but they are knowingwhat is to be done That is the beauty of the
thing traditional knowledge but we do notknow in modern time
Whenever we make a house we will not overhangright and say o it is hot of course it is
due to global warming there is a rise in temperaturebut we need to re look at this traditional
wisdom of making houses right Let us lookat another things of course there is one way
of putting this overhang here but there isa thick wall and having this angle also like
you know so that this again the summer suncannot uh can be avoided whereas the winter
sun can enter into the house so that is thething what you need to look at it
There are various designs you can think ofacross the country but unfortunately we have
not kept track of it and we do not have documentedat least I am not aware of it of course with
me limited resources and then time I am spendingfor this work this is not my usual work So
of course I had a talk with several civilengineering people and they say that they
are not having any information you know Ihave talked with various faculty members So
uhh and also if you look at the there is whatare the other advantages of inclined roofs
I used to wonder why they are making inclinedSo keep in mind these are the inclined house
and these of course strips are there thisbamboos or the strips and it is to protect
it from getting blown away by the wind okNow if you look at now what happens to the
solar Like if the solar rays are coming inand then what will happen it will be some
of this thing will be reflected
If I had been the flat one what it could havehappened Suppose if it I a flat house like
this is like a flat house what will happenThe sun will come and directly hot right but
here it is reflected back and some of theof course heat will be entering into here
and some of the heat will also go back sothat the less amount of heat will be retained
in the house and that is the beauty of puttingthis inclined roof and we are not doing it
ok And uhh of course the question arises whatwill be you know angle will be making this
angle what would it be and let me just mentionagain thing that relative ability of the roof
surface to radiate absorbed heat you knowbecause it will emit lot of radiations also
the same time and it is a bad insulation
This is also insulating materials and it willnot absorb the heat like concrete building
concrete building like you know and they willbe absorbing lot of heat But here it is not
this thing that is also another importantpoint ne can think of So let us look an aerodynamic
of a house like of course earlier days peoplewere putting the house near the trees and
there might be hillocks and that is the reasonwhy also people plant trees like neem Peepal
and mango etc around the house and so thatit will act as a barrier you know for the
wind and at the same time it allow the windto enter Are you getting
You are putting some barrier but the windwill come but if it is cyclone then there
will be a problem because if they are uprootedthe big trees can fall on the house and it
will be damaged So that is also one (()) (2809)but there are ways of doing people I remember
used to you know tie the tree old trees theywill make it you know identify it and tie
it also That they do but that is a maintenancework we need to take care And it also affects
your air quality will be improved by thesetrees ok particularly neem and even mangos
right So the shape of the building is veryimportant The building shape for withstanding
wind load generally rectangular shaped houseis being used width will be around 1.5 length
to length to width if you look at right 1.5and this is basically height to width this
height will be here right
You can talk about this is your width thiswill be height And height width 1 for use
basically if it is 1 it is a square houseso square houses are safest for the wind if
you look at most of the houses numbers willbe similar if you just look at except few
baring few they do not know how to build ahouse and in modern day we do not do And pyramid
shaped deep steep roof is best for avoidingwind force damage right and building orientation
is very important right because it to be fixedwith respect to direction from which wind
or the tidal force is coming Therefore generallyangle it will put it that is a very important
point which is there in Vaastu right And traditionalVaastu Shastra we look at for example if the
wind is coming over here right then it willimpact the wall but it will come over then
it will be diverted and then you know loadwill be less and that is being reflected in
the Vaastu itself
So therefore we will be you know discussingmore about the design of house in traditional
uh wisdom and in ancient days what peoplewere using there is a lot of science involved
in them they were practicing not talking aboutit So with this I will stop over and we will
be discussing more about rural housing andits scientific aspect in the next lecture
Thank you very much
