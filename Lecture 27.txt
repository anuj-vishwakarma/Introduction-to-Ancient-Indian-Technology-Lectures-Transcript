Let us start this lecture with a thought processWe have already spoiled the water and air
in the name of development which are the lifelineof all creatures in this world In the last
lecture we basically discussed about the watercrisis not only in the world but also from
the context of India And we looked at someof the things what our scripture is talking
about I gave a historical perspective andof course we will be looking at now uh dwelling
upon about the wells and other bodies
So if you look at Kupa is a well its sizevaries from 5 to 50 cubits of course I have
already told you earlier that 1 cubit is 45centimeter and this will be in diameter or
width because of the well can be of a youknow circular shape or it can be also square
or rectangular also It is generally havingno flight of steps to reach the water that
is basically known as Kupa Vapi means is astep well it is a large well with steps for
to you know number of steps should be thereto reach the water level Its size varies from
40 to 100 cubits as I told earlier its shapecan be square rectangular or circular It is
built to a depth of 10 cubits below the springas per the Vishwakarma Vasthushastra of course
there are several Vasthushastras and you mayfind these numbers it will be different The
Vapi is equal to ten Kupas in merit accordingto Matsya purana
As I told that people were having uh you knowbelief that if you will go and dig the well
or the put your money and do for public youwill get lot of uh blessings and therefore
if you could manage to dig a Vapi that meansyou will get more spiritual power or may be
blessings as compared to the simple wellsBathing ghats are provided in the Vapi sometimes
and only one side water lifting machine canbe placed There was also water lifting of
course at that time that will be may be leversystems which will be useful or may be water
wheel might be there at that time Pushkariniis basically a pond its size varies from 100
to 200 cubits in diameter in length GenerallyPushkarini is uhm not that circular I have
not seen generally it is a rectangular inshape
And Tadaga is a big water tank its size variesfrom 200 to 1000 cubits in diameter and length
And if you look at wells discovered Mohenjodaroand Harappan were the finest example from
the point of structural details And if yourecall that almost all houses had well for
domestic use besides this public wells werealso found in during Indus Valley Civilization
excavation areas Keep in mind that generallythe shapes of well are circular in nature
But if it is a big one generally like Vapior may be some other things so therefore step
wells will be sometimes uh also rectangular
So let us look at a typical Harappan circularwell if you look at this figure that this
is your well right This is the well and lookat the these are all bricks and this is bricks
are trapezoidal in nature and which is usedto prevent inward collapse Now suppose you
want to make this kind of well and I wantto replicate it I cannot because where I will
get trapezoidal bricks Who will make for meRight And at that time of course the people
were uh you know making their own brick kilnThey are having the kiln of their own they
can design and they can do that today it isnot possible Uh of course when I was a kid
uh you know uh I had gone to a village I rememberthat a person was trying to make a house and
he was also ma you know making a kiln forbaking the bricks with to be used you know
in his house The diameters of wells around3 to 4 feet as I told earlier this wedge shaped
bricks or the trapezoidal bricks are mouldedand burned properly
And the wider bricks are carefully curvedyou know this curving is also very essential
this portion to have a smooth surface andgenerally mud mortar uh was used to bind these
bricks And keep in mind that this is in aground which is uh what you call pavements
of the big brick laid here These are the bricksyou know if you look at these are the bricks
pavements around the well and which is havinga slope there will be some slope because this
is the your drain right There is also anotherdrain here drainage systems and one corner
it will be coming that maybe passing throughthis here to this place And beside this if
you look at the top of the well we are projectedabove the ground because this is the ground
level it is projected such that the wastewater will not enter into the well right So
it is well designed it is not that you knowpeople have done it is well designed kind
of things
And if you look at this this is the layoutof the Dholavira which we had discussed earlier
And what they were doing this as the rivuletsand they were having dams you know some places
here and they will take this water for thisF F if you look at reservoir and that is also
keeping this water similarly there is a alsoa dam having this place they will be using
this water that means they were having alsoconcerned about water how to preserve it and
do that That is a very important point whatwe can learn from them And there is a lot
of other lands where you know the water willbe available they will be storing it by the
rain also in the form of tanks in the formof ponds kind of things
If you look at Dholavira had a unique sophisticatedwater conservation system of channels I have
already shown you there is a channels andreservoirs built completely of stone and this
is one of the earliest found anywhere in theworld So if you look at this is made of stones
these are water reservoirs and there is astep well if you look at these are the steps
right and this is the well we are having thatmeans if the water will come and it will go
and charge also the underground Are you gettingthere is a stone and there is a river it will
go if any extra water it will go and storeso you can also use for the storing the underground
and whenever it is required you can use andalso it will be affecting the greenery around
that place So this Dholaviras Eastern Reservoiris a very big one it will be containing something
21170 meter cube Consider it will be something2 11 70000 liters it is a very huge amount
of water being stored in that and with a steppedwell as I told at the bottom
So this is a part of some other reservoirlike rock cut southern site of water reservoir
SR3 which is having 30 into 9 meters likethis length will be 33 and this will be around
9 meter with a secondary reservoir at thebottom There is another reservoir here you
know right which is a step and then it willbe coming reservoirs And 15.5 into 5.7 into
2 meters right kind of things what peoplehave excavated The archeologists could found
three massive reservoirs three of which wereused for storing fresh water brought by the
rains and to store water diverted from twonearby rivulets I had discussed that means
they were using the rain water for storageand also they were taking the water from the
rivulets or the rivers small rivers to storethem
And this clearly you know indicates that propermanagement of water harvesting is essential
to have a good life even in desert climateconditions of Kutch where several years may
pass without any rainfall So therefore severaldams were built to collect water and also
use it preserve it That means at that timepeople are having concern they were having
design they were doing it and properly andusing it Why not today But we will have to
not only preserve we will have to use alsosparingly that is important
Here I am showing you uh another undergrounddrainage system This is the drainage water
kind of system there where you can transportthe water and this is a again another opening
for the water being transferred Huge or smallunderground drains connecting several reservoirs
on the southern side one can see that meansit is not the reservoir alone they will be
connected also through that That means ifone reservoir there you can take water from
another and then use it right So connect supposethere is a flood one side what will happen
the other side it is not having the waterwill go to the other place and kept and will
be store there so that is also one inter connectivitywas there during that times
And if you look at these are of course excavatedand these are basically terracotta rings for
the well these are part of the wells Theseare the rings what you are people are using
of course this will be on the top and thenthis is being dug here and then you will get
the water inside right these are the wellsOf course were dominant in Rupnagar now people
are calling it Rupar right in Punjab dominatedand those are there you know in the 1st Millenium
BCE this is being you know dated by the archeologistsAnd beside this if you look at Terrakota rings
well at the Mamallapuram Pallava periods inthe like 575 AD â€“ 900 AD one can also find
So it is also uh you know uh people have foundout the earthen pipes and tunnels undergrounds
to maintain the flow of water besides transportingit to the distant places at various places
like Burhanpur in MP Golconda in AP Bijapurin Karnataka Aurangabad in Maharashtra and
several other places you know I have justmentioned few 0f them That means there was
a water harvesting system also the tunnelsand undergrounds were there to transport the
water from one place to other you know thatis very clear evidence uh are available you
know in our country at this moment
Let me talk about `Rani ki Vav if you lookat `Rani ki Vav it is basically built around
11th century a kind of sophisticated stepwell in Gujarat After the death of the husband
of a queen around 11 century and that is consideredas a world heritage site by UNESCO which described
it as exceptional example of technologicaldevelopment in utilizing ground water resources
And if you look at uh this is a quite complexstructure it is having you know these are
the steps and then it will various steps andthere will be here some various storey kind
of things storied buildings and you are havinga well here If you look at it was not known
earlier because it was buried under severallayers of slit for almost seven centuries
because you know around 1300 there was a floodin Saraswati River which closed all those
things and put a lot of silts on it
So only 30 years back people could unravelthere is something like that that Rani ki
Vav and it came to light Rani ki Vav was builtin the complex Maru Gurjara architectural
style there is a you know architecture likeKalinga in Odisha there is a Kalinga architecture
in each region is having their own way ofarchitecture So uh with an inverted temple
like temple will be like this and then itwill be other way around like inverted temple
And which holds more than 500 principle sculpturesof high artistic quality right its contains
Now for well why they will do that That onequestion comes to mind because our mind is
utilarian mind right
If look at I was telling there are uh severalsteps are there these are the steps you know
and there is also a kind of a sculptures arehere right It is quite elaborate and then
water of course will be here and may be inthe rainy season water may be filled and people
can you know use even like in uh above theground sorry just below the ground they can
use The magnificent structure measures approximately64 meter long I think this length will be
around may be 64 meter this length and thiswill be 20 meter width and 27 meter deep this
is a well what people had built earlier Andits unique feature is that there is a step
corridor compartment at regular interval andthese are all compartments which are stepped
And intervals of pillars multi storeyed pavilionsbecause these are the one storeyed two storied
like that it goes These are all pillars youknow if you look at so I mean why elaborately
one can build this way The one question arisesin my mind
And well is located at westernmost end ofthe uh property that as I told the that is
the and it consists of a shaft of 10 meterin diameter and 30 meter in deep that water
And this is the well if you look at this issomething around 10 meter in diameter and
depth is around 30 meter right and lot ofsculptures are there in this And evidence
suggests that the wall had been built of brickbut faced with the stone that means stone
was claded with the bricks How they couldhave done that One question because the stone
and this thing joined together That is theone question coming to my mind like in that
technology has to be unraveled From this wallright project vertical brackets in pairs you
know these are the all pairs are there rightand we supported different galleries of well
shaft kind of thing properly
The bracketing is arranged in tiers and isrichly carved if you look at these are carving
points So these are the if you look at carvedstructure you can get in wall you know if
you go to small region there you will findseveral of them various statues lot of fine
walls and stones and the therefore one cansay very clearly Rani ki Vav as the queen
among the step wells of India Till now sucha decorated and intricately designed and sculptured
well we have not come through Of course itis done but not that extensively therefore
that is being considered There is a smallgate below the last step of the step wells
was found leading to a tunnel of 30 km bywhich uh you know the king might escape whenever
a uh you know there is a fear to his lifedue to invasion or something and which leads
to the town of Sidhpur near Patan
Now if you think of that tunnel 30 km howthey built it And now we need to also to build
similar tunnels if it is a you know kind ofthings because lot of our Indian cities are
not having sewage system where people areliving now you want to put a tunnel to that
through which you can pass the sewage systemhow you will do it And one can learn from
that and keep in mind that now of course thisgate has been closed down because people may
misuse it and that is the marvel of that technologyat that time how people keep
And steps well are a distinctive form of subterraneanwater resource and storage systems on the
Indian subcontinent and this constructionis going on since the Harappan time It is
not that you know these people have startedthey have marveled the things So this is our
you know uh what you call step wells and wellswere there earlier days and is still continuing
but of course unfortunately today we are notusing it right We are just putting a pump
and using because if we use a well then youknow lot of water will be collected and also
another thing will be there you will be usingwater sparingly because you will have to use
it your physical labor to get the water fromthe well but if you use a pump it is very
easy and you misuse as much as you can Sotherefore we need to look at and lot of you
know uh things we can learn from them forusing the water in a fugal manner
Let me talk about a another you know interestingwell this is a Svastika Shaped well that is
also known as Nalumulaik Keni in Tamil probablyright And this well is located at Tiruvellarai
22.5 kms away from North East of Tiruchirapalliin Tamil Nadu made by Pallava uh Dantivarman
and 799 to 800 AD And this shape is lookinglike a if you look at this is basically a
uh Svastika kind of thing right you know ifyou look at this goes this way right and similarly
the other thing will be like this right thisis Svastika This is basically also known as
uh Maripidugu perun kinaru in Tamil big templewell it is a nearby a temple and its size
is around 37 square feet It might have usedfor temple and irrigation of devadana lands
because earlier days the temple were havingalso certain lands
And these are the steps if you look at theseare the steps where people can enter here
and take bath uh I do not know really andthere is a some support system there how they
will bring May be water will be coming hereand then they will be using right As I told
there are 4 entrances here one is here oneentrance here and another entrance will be
somewhere here and another will be here entranceright and this side also one entrance So inner
face of each portals and the out walls andmargins are made of dressed granite these
are granite stones So people were having concernand they have used a lot of you know technology
at that time wherever uh whichever were thereavailable at that time and then were trying
to make these things
And if you look at like there is a lot ofwater tanks in the temple and water from the
temple tanks served the vital purpose of rechargingthe underground aquifers reducing the runoff
enhancing the water stagnation time thus ensuringthe sufficient water in the domestic wells
during the summer months So if you look atthis is one of the uh what you call tanks
I have shown which is connected with one templein South and I will be uh also talking about
a little bit about the temple water tanksin the next lecture so here I will stop over
and because temple is a very important partof our culture and therefore also the water
harvesting you can see there Thank you verymuch
