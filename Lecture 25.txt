Let us start this lecture with a thought processtowns in modern India should be planned in
such a way that it must not only grow cropsand produce most of the basic needs of all
its inhabitants while a cordial relationshipwith modern nature should be maintained as
in the ancient India In the last lecture wediscussed about the town planning in the both
first phase and second phase of civilisationand we will continue today with certain other
cities which were discussed in the last lecturelike Vijaypuri which is in Telangana and that
flourished around 225 AD to 325 AD
And this city was found during the excavationat Nagarjunkonda tank you know if you look
at this is a very big tank which was beingmaintained by the people for the and used
for water for water and it had a well thoughtplan with a citadel and residential areas
Citadel is the place where the king and theother places will be there Citadel was fortified
with a moat rampart gate and other thingsand a tank with elaborate drainage system
was having and houses with linear patternswith roads These roads were basically similar
to what was found in Harappan civilisationI think that process might be continuing till
this period and it had a amphitheatre witha gallery on all sides bathing ghats
If you look at some of the remnants shownhere of course near this Nagarjunkonda tanks
and of course some portion will be there itis made out of stone basically Let us look
at now the another city which is Arikamedunowadays it is known as Pondicherry and which
flourished around 1100 to 1200 AD kind ofthing City was basically a trade centre and
who were having trades with roman empire whichwas established on the eastern bank of a Lagoon
formed by Ariyankuppam river around 3 km fromsouth of Pondicherry It had 150 ft long oblong
brick structure of a warehouse near the waterlevels like I think maybe some of these are
warehouse where you can store the materialsElaborate series of conduits and pavements
of large stones were found in these excavatedregion and indicating that these are maybe
for the water transport and other things
And elaborate drainage system with corbelledwall floored with horizontal bricks were also
found in this site and which indicate thatyou know they have a very good drainage system
and space system for the disposal of the garbageAnd Warangal is in Telangana nowadays earlier
of course it was in Andhra Pradesh this citywas flourished around 1200 1400 AD during
Kakatiya dynasty period and I had happenedto visit this place maybe few years back I
was not that much interested in this partof ancient technology But I was thrilled to
see these kinds of gates which were made ofgranite stone and very good work you can see
very intricate work being done And how itwas done really is interesting to look at
as granite is very hard stone difficult tomanage
And it had four arched stones gates like thisone here the four sides of the fort and uhh
which is of course the fort was a cardinalpoint and four roads of the city converge
at the temple in the middle of the city andI remember that there was a nearby mountain
and mountain was having staircase made ofstone right from there itself and even today
it is there and four free standing portalsleading into this temple and there is very
good if you look at these are elephants andvery nice intricate works are there and there
are several other things
And I had also seen at that time there isa tank water tank made of stones and there
was also a well which is having linings werethe stones So how they have put it and make
it made it is a really important thing onehas to think at that time So Vijayanagar empire
which is at Karnataka and it was around somethingfrom 1400 1700 AD you might be knowing Krishnadevaraya
who was a very well known king of Vijayanagarempire And capital city known as Hampi was
found in eastern bank of Tungabhadra riverright And these are some remnants of the capital
of the palace which is having lot of stonesand these are the part of the palace maybe
some you know meant for some kind of a hallor something because lot of pillars you could
see It had a massive fortification for ellipticzone around 400 km along its axis and enough
evidence of drainage systems roads residentialand civic buildings irrigation systems were
found in this excavation site
On the south western side a cluster enclosedby high granite walls royal palace treasury
temples column halls this is one I think partof it and water tower tanks and wells were
found That mean it is very clearly can beconcluded that the city was well planned and
then it was really good and then lot of designsmight have gone into forming this city and
also maintaining it So literary evidence ifyou look at there are several text available
on town planning in medieval period and someof these are Brahat Samhita Mayamata Manasara
Yuktikalpataru Samarangana Sutradhara SukracharyasNitisastra and several other even you will
find those texts today And the Manasara awork of 11 century AD is exhaustive treatise
on town planning which we will be discussingsome of the features of Manasara As to the
Manasara this cities will be built near theriver sea or mountain with provision of trade
and commerce
And roads would be laid from east to westor north to south as per the site requirements
and smallest town has around 100 into 200cubits according to this classifications Cubits
I have already discussed 1 cubit will be around0.45 meters Big towns have something 7200
into 14000 cubits area and eight types oftowns what this Manasar had identified one
is Rajadhani Nagara Pura Nagari Kheta kharvataKubjaka and Pattana so these are also various
kinds of cities you know And Nagara had ahigh concentric walls with watch towers massive
gates strong doors and moats filled with watercrocodiles etc these are the main for protecting
the fort and streets are lighted with torches
The main topics covered on the town planningin Mayamata and Manasara are Bhumi Pariksha
I mean basically examination of land whichland will be suitable for having a city and
Bhumi Samgraha is basically selection of thetown site Dikpariccheda determination of cardinal
point that means where your citadel will bethere kind of things so that will be cardinal
point of the city And Padavinyasa surveyingmapping of areas marking into square and rectangle
because that is being preferred for makingthe houses Balakarma Vidhana that is sacrifice
of offerings I mean there is a ritual whichwas there till I think some years back when
we are having this rituals
Grama Nagara vinyasa village and town planningBhumi vinyasa construction of storey buildings
Gopura Vidhana construction of gateways howto make what are the materials all those things
Rajavesma Vidhana that means constructionof kings Palace Palace can be somebody elses
but kings palace is very important and thenalso intricate in design Mandapa Vidhana construction
of temple of course I will be not be discussingthis lecture about temple because it is quite
vast and we will not be doing that And severalpersons namely Grhadyapati the minister of
town planning Sthapati master architectureSutragrahik surveyor Taksaka chief carpenter
and Vardhaik carpenter in hierarchal ordersyou know are to be employed and then they
are the people who designs the buildings andthe towns and they will also be executing
they will be responsible for that
It very clearly says that in modern as inmodern times other time also the you know
set of engineers were there these are basicallyengineers who were doing Types of town topology
in ancient India several of them mentionedin this book One is Dandaka Sarvathobhadra
Nandyavartha Padmaka Swastika Prastara KarmukaChaturmukha and some of these things we will
be discussing about that
If you look at Dandaka it look like this thisis a topology of a city If you look at this
is your uhh northern gate this is one gatehere and similarly eastern gate here and there
might be a citadel in somewhere in the townAnd this shape if you look at is basically
rectangular or can be square shape and roadsthese are roads these are basically roads
straight roads and these two are bigger roadsyou know It will be crisscrossing these roads
and these are by lanes right and width ofthis streets vary from 1 to 5 danda and to
uhh transverse street at the extremities havesingle rows of house If you look at these
rows single rows of house and this will beone road also this is also roads And Devi
temple is located outside the village whereasthe Devta temple is in the northern portion
of the city Even today you will find lot ofcities is having Devis at the entrance of
the village or a city and that culture isstill today we are having
Sarvathobhadra city will be like that If youlook at this arrow if I am putting it is basically
northern side right and this is your easternside and this is having one gate here and
there is another gate here there is anothergate 4 gates basically but besides this in
the corner you are having also small passageswhere people can live and this type of town
planning meant particularly for square sitesor a rectangular site that can be used for
larger villages and towns not for small onesAs per this plan the entire town should be
fully occupied by the houses of various descriptionsand inhibited by all classes of people That
means there is no segregation between classesexcept these places that might be for some
fortification or some other things which willbe there at the periphery maybe warrior people
or classes will there to protect the cityor maybe it will be taken by the king who
will be protecting the city or administratorcity administrator
Nandyavarta is basically a name of a flowerthe form of which is followed in this layout
this will be one kind of layout which willbe Nandyavarta this is circular in nature
At the centre there will be temple of courseat the centre also the chief administrator
or the king will be residing There will beof course preceding deity in the centre of
the town and if you look at this is the roadMain roads here and similarly this is crossing
And besides these there will be other roadswhich are meeting at this temple and these
are small lanes which are parallel to eachother you know that is parallel to this side
that is a very interesting part right theseare parallel similarly this is parallel
This is generally adopted also for squareif you look at this is square size kind of
thing and here in the centre there will beyou know temple and also the people who are
controlling the city or the administratorwill be there And here of course these are
the roads and this is good suitable aroundsomething 3000 to 4000 houses of course today
you cannot adopt that because people willbe thinking about 30000 to 40000 houses and
as I told the streets run parallel to thecentre joining streets you know these are
the things lanes are connected to the mainstreets
And there is a Padmaka which is similar tothe petal of Lotus and radiating outwards
from the centre and this was practiced forbuilding the town with fortress all around
These are will be basically fortress wallsor for fortification and city used to be practical
an island surrounded by water where you canhave having no scope for expansion therefore
the city has been made in such a way Of coursethese are we need to look at it where it was
lying I remember the Shivaji Chatrapati Shivajihad made some kind of a city inside the island
maybe it is of that shape I do not know youcan cross check that
Swastika is another one which is similar tothe you know earlier things in rectangular
and these are having diagonal you know streetsdividing certain rectangular plots These are
you know rectangular plots if you look atpeople can live in that so if you look at
these are the main roads this is one gatehere and if you look at this road will be
like this one can think of joining here andto this gate there is another gate here Similarly
one can think of this is like a swastika theseare the roads this looks to be like a Swastik
kind of thing Two main street each other atthe centre this is your centre and running
south to north and west to east Site wouldrestrict it to square and rectangular so that
it can fit into this Rampant walls aroundthis town with a moat at it foot filled with
water
Prastara will be having what you call similarin the shape rectangular shape or maybe square
It does not suit for triangular or circularshape Main roads are much wide if you look
at these are the main roads and that sideright of course this is the centre These are
of course the main gates gate here this isthe northern side this is the eastern side
one gate here one gate there this might besmall passages and you can look at that these
are bigger plots means you know it can beoccupied by the rich people that is what one
can guess and these are little bit smallerof course this is the next size right which
will be for the middle class this maybe alsoidle class this maybe the poor class kind
of thing poor class in the sense maybe fromeconomically The town may or may not be surrounded
by a fort this is what we talked about Prastara
And there is a Karmuka which is a very halfcircle kind of thing and this kind of plan
is suitable for sea shore or river bank becauseone side would be there And it can be circular
in shape because this is a half circle andthese are also gate kind of things Main streets
you know run from north to south east to thatis alright and street divide the entire area
in blocks so these are the streets and theseare lanes and these places of course you can
have a house and it will connect to the mainlanes And this is you know the place where
all people will come meet and maybe you arehaving a business centre here in the centre
and so also in this there might be a streetalso here this type And generally preceding
deity commonly Devi is installed in the templebuilding in any convenient place
And Chaturmukha of course is a from name itselfthere will be four gates This is northern
gate this I eastern gate and then this willbe southern gate and western gate here And
these are having equal sizes houses of coursethe side one are the larger size land areas
which will be meant for the administrativepeople to manage this city properly or from
or protect the city from the enemies Thissite can be used for the square or rectangular
having four faces or four gates Generallythe temple you know is being considered near
by the centre where there might be a templewhere people will come and do pujas So we
have seen that various kinds of town planningyou know in the literature of course I have
shown you very few of them But some of thesetown planning or the layout can be utilised
today in the present context also and it hasto be done properly right
Let us look at the materials used for theconstruction of ancient India As we have already
learned there are several materials like stonebricks mortars plasters wood timbers iron
other metals were used in ancient times andbrick if you look at in ancient India is very
old Let me tell you that brick wells in theHarappan times this is the well which we had
we will be seeing and also later on and thisis the falcon fire altar which is used in
Vedas for making yagyas and other things rightAnd this is the brick temple during the Gupta
period it is nearby Kanpur in Bhitargaon whichis still existing because I had vested this
place maybe two years back and it is quiteinteresting temple and made out of brick not
stone
And bricks if you look at the Sanskrit wordIstika denotes brick which means comfort and
giving or well being kind of thing on beingburned the mud blocks by fire was turned into
bricks of course according to Sathapatha BhramanVeda sage Angirus was the authority on brick
making And bricks were used as I told in IndusValley civilisation and Vedic period and later
on also even today we are using bricks Bricksif you look at is mainly made from the clay
with of course natural impurities of the soillike quartz calcite Kaolinite organic materials
and others things right
And suitability of the clay from the brickdepends on the nature of minerals which is
there in the clay and also the shape of ofthe size of the grains presence of soluble
salts and organic materials you know thatis very important thing one has to look at
it For enhancing plasticity several othermaterials like fine sands slags organic materials
like rice husk chopped straw and other thingsare usually added According to Yajurveda Samhita
and Sathapatha Brahmana hair of goats poundrocks and iron filling are mentioned to be
added for enhancing the plasticity of clayfrom making bricks But of course these are
the things has to be tested that is true ornot but however some of the materials can
be even still used like your fine sand whichis being used today Baudhayaya Sulabha sutra
has mentioned about the use of Ukhya Bhasmabasically ash as additive for making the brick
So several types of bricks namely rectangularsquare wedged shaped L shaped even light weighted
decorated inscribed bricks are being mentionedin the various texts If you look at these
are various shapes even the square rectangularthis is trapezoidal this is L shape I will
be discussing about that in the particularlywhen you use when you make this wells you
need to have a trapezoidal bricks and alsowhen you make an arc the brick you know size
and shapes would be congruent with the alignproperly otherwise it will not align properly
And if it will not align it will fall down
So therefore those kind of sizes has to beyou know made and also how we can do today
we cannot do because we do not know how tomake yourself bricks the company or the industry
will do Industry will not make according toour wish according to our design Earlier days
I remember that brick was basically beingdesigned and developed in rural areas by the
people Even like light weight bricks foundin Rammpaa temple at Palampet in AP Sikhara
is of low density that even can float in waterHow you can make because generally clay mixed
with lime stone saw dust etc when burned willbe releasing carbon dioxide becomes porous
and becomes lighter and that kind of thingswere there earlier days you know and today
you will not find that kind of bricks
And process of bricks or tile making is beingmentioned in the Shilpa Ratna and one has
to select the suitable site and collectionof soil because the soil has to be taken from
the particular site and the site has to beselected One has to wet the you know and then
add whatever the ingredients having mix itproperly and then knead it for making bricks
Hand moulding of the bricks were being usedearlier days it must be sun dried and kiln
has to be prepared and for firing of bricksCooling and quenching of bricks is very important
because you cannot really you know removeas it is the rate of cooling is important
for getting a good quality bricks it has beenmentioned in Shilpa Sastra And there is some
standard has to be maintained if it is notmeeting the standard then it has to be rejected
There is also way of testing the bricks andclassification and qualities of the brick
also has to be taken care while you are doingthat So suitable soil selection of bricks
what people have talked about is somethingfour types of soil colour wise it is basically
white is the best because plasticity willbe better red is good and yellow if you look
at is average and black is the worst for makingbricks And according to that is your Vishnudharmottar
Purana this is 3 volumes (())(2658) you knowtranslated from Sanskrit to the English Clay
soil must be able show several propertiesthat can be useful for making bricks plastic
when mixed with water that is very importantand it must have enough tensile strength to
keep it safe clay particles must not fusetogether because then it will be brittle in
nature right
So ancient brick kiln if you look at was mainlyfor clamping of bricks and tiles in piles
then burring together in a kiln And temperatureof kiln around 200 degree Celsius was used
earlier times even today also with the helpof burning the twigs of trees like peepal
khadir palash any other trees As a matterof fact maybe why this they have mentioned
that has to be looked at And this is a typicalwhat you call as shown in ancient time people
were doing even in some areas they do Thereis a hole where they will be using these logs
of wood for burning and they will be havingthis things what you call mud walls being
done And even I am aware that in using thecow dung people could bake this pottery and
maybe I do not know whether people use cowdung for baking the bricks or not
Of course in modern time smoke pipes werekept in the kiln But there might be some kind
of a smoke pipe at that time maybe just ahole and bricks or tiles are allowed to bake
for about 10 15 days and this technology isstill used in rural areas of India Africa
and many other to produce bricks in smallscale But nowadays it is not there because
when I was a kid I had seen a brick kiln inmy village but today it is not there and people
do not know how to also make a kiln themselves
Still today in India this production of thebricks you know by local tradition is around
20 percent some people claim but I am doubtfulabout it And it is of course considered to
be inefficient process by certain expert asit lacks thermal insulation and also the burning
may not be that good Those things you knowlike one has to look at when we want to revive
this kind of technology One has to also improviseit because there is a break in the transfer
of knowledge from the previous generationto the next generation that might be a lot
of problem in that as we see today
And the brick bonds if you see there are severalkinds mentioned in the text Toda or Patti
is basically third kind of things and todameans if you look at is a basically third
layer of joining If you look at this is theone brick right and this is the second one
this is second layer and another layer willbe this one that means this brick layer this
brick thing is being repeated here joininghere it is repeated in the third layer Similarly
4th 5th 6th 7th 9th 12th 14th kind of thingvarious names are given here like Mallaleel
Brahmaraaj Panchaparva Poogparva DevsandhiSwarna and Dandaka I think these names are
in Marathi if you look at in English it goesby that
I will show you some of them 5th layer thatmeans if you have this laying of the bricks
in wall in such a way that this will be thejoint let us say these two bricks you know
will be repeated after the fifth layer thatmeans if you do that then it will be strength
will be much higher But unfortunately we areonly using the third layer kind of thing today
we do not I have never seen 5th layer peopleare using even if you look at the 7th layer
which will be this kind of repetition willbe coming in the at the 7th layer similarly
9th 12th and 14th you know one has to findout where you can use you cannot really use
this higher you know layer in all the workSo therefore these things can be looked at
in details and then also find out its utilityso the strength of the wall can be enhanced
34:02So mortar can be defined as materialused for cementing bricks stone kind of things
we know while plaster is the material usedfor coating the walls right In ancient times
mud was used as the universal mortar and plasteras we had seen in the rural housing lectures
Gypsums lime mortar or the plasters were usedsince the Indus valley civilisation and even
the light grey colour gypsums were used inHarappan buildings were people have found
out Lime and mud mortars were used in Kousombiin 600 BC 200 AD in Gupta periods and composition
of the gypsum and the lime in plasters andmortars in Harappa and Mohenjodaro If you
look at the in the mortar you will find something74.12 percent gypsum and calcium carbonate
2.5 and magnesium carbonate nil and then sandand clay is around 20.41 percent alkaline
salt 1.18 of course moisture will be thereSo this is the kind of things Mohenjodaro
Of course if you go to Harappa it is changingit is different you know sand and clay is
almost double right and there is less amountof gypsum But if you look at this main drains
of this from Mohenjodaro you look at thiscalcium carbonate is more and there is magnesium
carbonate comes into picture and maybe thesand and clay is little higher side So one
has to say that it is not the same it is differentproportion coming but most of the materials
are similar in nature These people have youknow tested it taking the samples from the
Mohenjodaro and Harappa Harappan site
And this is from the Kousombi the people havetested it Let us say these are sample 1 sample
3 5 7 there are several samples I have takenonly few of them and sand is something 33.43
and slaked lime that is 41.11 3 by 4 is theratio being used It may be used for basically
as a mortar kind of things where for the plastermaybe it is 39.13 to 37.09 kind of things
1 is to 1 sorry this may be used 1 is to 1might be used for the for the mortar and 3
is to 4 might be used for plaster right Similarlyfor this fifth one may be used for mortar
right and this is used also maybe for uhhkind of mortar so various ratios are being
used for this mortars and plasters in Kousombiand several data you can get out of it
So let us look at how one can prepare thelime and mortar And excavation of limestone
from the underground mines has to be undertakenand one has to calcinate it by burning of
limestone and one has to quench it with waterto obtain a slaked lime Of course the sieving
of the material to remove stones and otherimpurities is also important Lime mortar is
prepared by mixing lime with sand Pulverisationis maybe required for lime to obtain the mortar
and this is maybe done manually and as perthe Bhrugu Samhita They have also mentioned
about various sand sizes for lime mortarsThis is Karal the Hirda seed size and Mugdi
green gram seed size they have mentioned thatway and Gulmash medium sized sand Kalk the
Bengal gram flour sized Chikna is a fine silt
So they have you know developed their wayof specifying the size of giving the example
of various seeds so that they can utilizekeep that in mind not like in present day
you know some mm kind And according to theMayamata chapter 18 there is various grades
of lime the first class is the of course setsquickly in water second class sets slowly
in water and third class sets slowly I meanlittle bit will take more time Fourth class
will be not be setting at all that is thekind of limes they have graded
And if you look at one can think of kiln forcalcination like they will be using the wood
and charcoal here by layer by layer Theseare the lime stones and they will be heating
by putting this something wood fire and thenheating it and then the gases will be going
out that way carbon dioxide they will be maintainingsomething 900 to 1000 degree Celsius then
this calcium carbonate will be converted toCaO calcium oxide and carbon dioxide Calcium
oxide will be coming in contact with waterit will become calcium hydroxide Once it is
there then you can use add this sand and thenyou can use for masonary purposes Traditional
small scale batch type limekiln is also usedearlier and which is known as Ulai in Tamil
nadu Let me show you a kiln here It is basicallymade out of bricks and then in this case the
wood and charcoal along with the limestonewill be placed and then it will be heated
from the top kind of things and then it willbe converted into slaked lime
So we will see the plaster and wall preparationfor paintings very special materials from
the plaster to be used on the wall particularlywhen you are trying to paint it And uhh as
I mentioned the book that is VishnudharmottarPurana discuss lateral technique for such
applications And plaster used on the wallsare Ajanta caves Sirgiria caves and Bagh caves
were created using might be such techniqueswhat is mentioned but still more research
has to be done to find out In addition tothe plasters the technique of producing different
colours were elaborated and lot of researchis going on particularly this Ajanta caves
like people are saying this plaster will behaving clay cow dung stone powder rice husk
and lime and people are saying that this paintsare remaining because of this speciality
And also in recent time somebody did researchand claimed that the tobacco was being used
in Ajanta paints so that it has still beingthere intact So in the Sirgiria caves tempered
clay kaolin rice husk coconut shell fibresand lime were used and the bagh caves red
clay green gram lime and jute were being usedfor the plasters and kind of things Therefore
you know a lot of things we can learn fromthis things and a use even today we can revive
those things but more research is required
Let us conclude that what we can learn fromthe past and utilise and at least conceptual
wise What we need to do that basically indigenousarchitecture generally was in close association
with Mother Nature and sustainability ecofriendly is the part and parcel of the ancient
buildings and also the town planning Localmaterials can be used while improving the
skill of local people Because when you dothat then you know skill will be there with
the people and they can uhh be more innovativeand then utilise it their creative power
And building technology and town planningmust be indigenous based on the local ecology
tradition and culture which is not the casetoday right Traditional knowledge system should
be preserved More research should be carriedout to implement the old knowledge in the
present context Proper amalgamation of passivecooling techniques in modern buildings can
be made such that it can reduce the energyconsumption which I did not cover but I must
tell you that I am having certain data peoplehave conducted in the ancient you know way
of making house ad which can even you knowmaintain their comfortable temperature after
the global warming so we must adapt insteadof just going for the air conditioner and
other systems So with this w e will stop overher In the next lecture we will be discussing
about basically how to conserve the waterand also how to manage the water in proper
way for irrigation and other things so thatwe will not face problem in modern times using
the ancient technology thank you very much
