Let us start this lecture with a thought processIf want to achieve excellence it can only
be achieved through ceaseless energetic actionsYou will have to put your 100% then only you
can achieve excellence and it should be continuousnot that you will achieve So let us recall
what we learnt In the last lecture we basicallylearnt about the green revolution which was
being you know introduced in this countrywith a fan fair and it amounts to be a not
really green revolution
It is basically greedy revolution you cansay and it has created lot of problems and
which is difficult to solve And we have lookedat also the uses of pesticides and then fertilizers
and other thing we will continue the discussionon how this pesticides you know causing the
havoc in the human life And of course in thelast lecture I didn’t talk about what are
the types of pesticides You are aware whatare available in modern time Any idea I’ll
give an example how you will classify
For example there will be mice or the rodentyou know in the land there will be also Similarly
there will be weeds weeds you know There isa some unwanted plants will be coming up that
we need to remove Yes Similarly there mightbe some other what you call insects and other
things will be coming Some there will be larvaSo based on that you know pesticides have
grouped according to types of pests whichthey need to eliminate or kill right So that
that’s why it has been divided insecticidesbasically there will be several insects so
you will have to overcome them by killingthem by using some chemicals or paralyze them
you know by using certain chemicals
And the Herbicides which is also known asweed killers because those are unwanted But
we will see now our ancient time what theywere doing and how they were overcoming that
problem They were not thinking that you knowlike we will see later on that those are really
a problem And rodenticides like I told rodentsor may be rats or the mice you know all those
things like
So those are rodenticides rodenticides onecan use it and bactericides there is bacteria
lot of things are coming up which will beyou know detrimental for the plant growth
and also the seed productions or the grainproductions that way So those are and of course
the fungicides use a fungus will be developedyou know like you will have to and larvicides
there will be larvae you know so that it willbe also affecting the plant growth or the
production of the grains
So if look at that worldwide it is basicallywhat is the use insecticides is a 44% this
is the basically herbicide 30% and fungicideis more here and others are 5% those are very
very small But in our country India we useinsecticides are 76% of course it is in tropical
region we have seen that we are having lotof what do you call species in the what you
call that is what do you call not land masswe are having actually a lot of insects and
then animal you know like kind of things thereforewe need to have taken care Herbicides is basically
about 10% we use and fungicide 13% rest is1% So that is the distribution we do I am
like an we use as of now This is I have takenfrom some research paper
And if look at this pesticides we are discussingsomething about use of you know fertilizers
or the ill effect of fertilizers and pesticideswe will continue now There is a various disease
I’ve taken some of the them like if youlook at Endometriosis is basically a disease
in which uterine tissue growth outside theuterus you know like particularly for the
women you know a common cause of infertilitywas virtually unheard of something may be
twenty to thirty years back But today it ismore predominant
It now affects the 5.5 million women in theUS and Canada ok and of course in our country
we don’t have I couldn’t manage to getthe data but it will be may be more you know
if not less And 10 to 20% women of childbearingage you know that is affecting During this
period they get these problems Ok And TheNational Institute of Child Health and Human
Development noted that only 20 cases reportedin medical literature prior to 1921 It is
not a common this I’ve given the references
So this that is the reason why today the youknow you are having several problems of producing
babies right You might have seen In Indiathere are several sophisticated method also
being utilized for producing baby which wasa natural one because of problems created
by our food and then also using pesticidesand fertilizers So there is another disease
which is Hypospadias and all of them you maynot be aware because I was not aware a condition
in which this Hypospadias in which urethrais near the penis this is for about the male
right that is for the female not end as itshould be has a double in the last 10 years
these are the data what they are saying Andsimilar things will be in our country also
ok
And Undescended testicles right which is linkedwith the rather risk testicular cancers is
increasing right and researchers have reporteda double in cases of 1962 1982 in England
and Wales And these studies actually we arenot very good at we are just using we are
not aware Because our medical research youknow are really couldn’t co-op with this
kind of pressure what we are having todayDoctors I was talking with doctor why you
people are not keeping the data
See where is the time to breath and whereto keep the data and there is also attitude
problem So it is very important to keep thedata to know right But they are not keeping
I talked with several of my friends who aredoctors and so therefore we don’t have have
data I can’t say I we don’t have datadata will be there but it is not been talked
about Might be some Kannada some where somebodywill be keeping
So Precocious puberty in girls is now commonYou might be observed particularly your own
girls you know puberty period is being prematurelybeing done now-a-days and it is a very and
even my I remember that you know we have inour family and other relatives we are having
discussion on that and I am sure this is happeningbecause of food and they have identified this
you know and they conducted study of 17077girls in USA found that onset of puberty for
white girls is 6-12 months earlier than expectedok and which is not the right one and African
– American experienced puberty 12-28 monthsearlier than the whites Of course this is
a study of 1997 almost 20 years back but stillyou know it is an alarm because of that they
link to the using of pesticides and also thefertilizers
And Reduced Sperm counts in was also documentedbetween 1938-1990 sperm counts dropped by
1.5% each year for American men and 3.1% peryear for European men I think this thing will
be you know use of the pesticide will be oneof the cause there might be several other
causes according to me Of course I have takenthe data from some paper they say that but
I feel personally there will be several othercauses for this For example-sedentary lifestyle
for example they will be sitting down fora quite some time particularly you know when
you talk about male either male this discussionwe are talking about males the male will be
that might be food habits So lot of thingswill be during that and this is one of the
thing
So fertility problems are becoming more commonand now affect more than two million couples
in US And in India also you will find lotof people are not having actually in particularly
those who are not doing you know physicalwalk those who are going to doing the stressful
jobs that is the thing what I have talkedwith some of my friends and they are also
saying that way those are involved So theseare you know problems what is there
Pesticide consumption in India if you lookat it is basically it is increasing from 1956
onwards and at a very higher rate of courseit you know during particularly 1968 to this
but after this 1992 this kind of things isdecreasing again there is a little bit increase
I don’t have data beyond 2001 And that mightbe two reasons for this one is that people
start of realizing the you know pesticideill effects of pesticides Other thing is that
one data is showing to me that we are usingstarted this cotton genetically modified cotton
and then that is the reason why you know youmight be getting a drop in that Of course
I am not advocating for the genetically modifiedseed because I am having deservation so also
people are having
Practice that that we need not to temper thenature right and if will nature if will temper
that then the greedy people market sourceswill be misusing it and we do not know its
ramification in the long run So thereforeI am not suggesting to go for that might one
of the reason why I am saying that you lookat the data cotton pesticide congestion by
different crop if you look at cotton is 45%so if they are using the genetically modified
cotton BMC or what they call BM Cotton right
So natural it will be drop down ok Are yougetting my point This my argument I am trying
to give why it is so And rest of the thingsif you look at rice is measured and then wheat
and then pulses are the things pesticide hasbeen used These are the percentages I have
given 45% cotton rice 22% and then wheat isvery less 4% pulses kind of things So therefore
that might be but we need to you know eliminateyou know or we can use some pesticide which
is natural I will be may be talking aboutwhat our some of our people have developed
by looking at the scriptures
Our ancient technology has been revived forthe agriculture in recent time So I will be
talking later on how you can avoid becauseyou have balance you have lost the balance
the nature now you will have to live withit like this You cannot say look I go back
to the older time when there is no balanceeverything nature is working properly no you
cannot So therefore you will have to do somethingto overcome that problem and getting learning
the natural way of doing it
So side effects of pesticides if you lookat – Effects on physical environment for
example this methyl bromide and ozone depletionall those things is a problem Acute poisoning
and occupational exposure of farmers and agriculturalworkers with you know known endocrine-disrupting
compounds because this being used in the pesticidesAnd also suspected to be carcinogens and nerve
toxins and what people have and what peoplehave reported million human pesticides poisoning
like being reported and 220000 deaths areattributed to pesticides worldwide per year
right This is the very alarming kind of thingsyou know it’s not only with India alone
it’s across the (coun) the world
So Dietary exposure to the endocrine –disruptingcompound known or suspected carcinogens somethings
are known and somethings suspected you knowand these are nerve toxins not only carcinogen
but also nerve toxins kind of things So Potentialsynergistic effects of exposure to environmental
toxins with with similar mechanism of toxicityyou know like because not only this from the
pesticide from the other fronts also theyare being you know mixed so that is a one
effect one has to look Got it
And we know the Soil Degradation I will betalking about soil after this They reduce
biological activity and diversity Becausewe are using monoculture diversity is very
important to maintain the soil quality andsoil not getting degraded And as I told Dietary
exposure and safety of the existing tolerancelevels and tolerance level of the persons
are also taken because immunization systemis at stake So therefore the tolerating the
things also is decreasing day by day of thepeople
And as I told earlier the pesticide affectthe predaceous-beneficial organisms over the
pest right because you want to target onebut there is a non-target pests are there
so those also will be and creating the resurgencein the population of pest organisms that over
there you want to kill somebody and it hasbeen you know increasing it alarming their
products and rate are there fertility ratebeing higher This another problem what we
face kind of thing due to the use of it
And worldwide estimate of this cost in rangeof something 100 billion annually this data
have taken 1993 little old I mean like 20years back for mitigation of environmental
damage due to the pesticide Now this numbercould have been 10 fold you know at least
So I mean that I want to say that what arethe side effects of that
How does modern farming pollute our environmentWhat is the really it is going on If you look
at let us look at the whole pictures and therewill be what you call application of pesticides
right You are using this plants there mightbe deposition there on the surface of the
leaves the root and the soil and then it willget into you know crops will be run of into
it endo drift kind of things it can go todiffuse and contaminate land run of right
It can go to the points source if contaminationlike somewhere there and it will go to the
water it will go to the drainage and someof the spray when you were doing it will be
evaporated because you do fumugative spray
It may evaporate and go to that atmosphereright And there is also water resources it
will go and it can go to the seepage it canreach is not the ground water you know are
you getting So then again it will be whenyou use this water it is having those pesticides
components chemicals and there is a of courseit can evaporate with the water See it can
go by spraying and it can water can evaporatewhen you are irrigating it And then it will
come back and then short or long distanceit will go
So if you look at this is the whole chainwhich is being talked about how it is going
on so it is very difficult to overcome nowyou know because it is going everywhere where
to search Where to go now Even if you stopusing pesticides and the chemical fertilizer
you will have live with for another may be20 30 years to overcome that when you make
it zero now Now where to go That is the biggestchallenge we have created because due to the
use of modern science and technology
And Indian soil I am like as I told the soilis very important therefore we call it in
our ancient scripture `Matha Bhoomi putramprathibhyam’ Now land is very important
that we can’t because it is having a lifeas I told in the last lecture the soil is
the soul of infinite life So therefore itis important that’s what our scripture has
talked about If you look at the soil how youcan classify Any idea Any idea Because…
Student: Clay soil Laterite soil blunt soilblack soil red soil
Professor: Ok Any other things For example:-We are having Alluvial soil India is having
a load with that because we are having gangeticplains rivers you know lot of rivers are there
and you will get around 43% which are verygood for agriculture We are having Red soil
as you told rightly 18.5% We are having Blackor regur soil around 15% of course desert
we are having this country is having alsodesert you know in the western side right
The Gujarat right Sorry Rajasthan ok Aridand then Laterite soil and this Saline soil
we are having also because and also becauseof bad practice of agriculture our soil becoming
Saline and there is a Marshy soil and Forestsoil
If look at of course this is little old thisthing I’ve shown in the Himalayan regions
and this Uttarakhand these are all basicallyforest and mountainous which are very different
Today we are spoiling this you know this Uttarakhandarea there is lot of industry lot of these
things we are spoiling those place which arevery good And this reason Alluvial soil if
we look at Gangetic plains and then this portionof the Gujarat and these are of course the
desert you know like in the Rajasthan thisportion is the desert soil Arid soil this
is Arid you know soil and this portion isbasically the Black kind of soils and this
is the Red and Yellow soils and this portionso if look at these are the distribution various
kinds
So depending on your soil you will have tocultivate you know you cannot really say that
what I’ll do So this is very important whatwe are using with modern technology mechanical
will doing the similar thing everywhere thatis should not be done We will have to have
a understanding and do that
So if look at problem of Salinity in the soilSaline soils are characterized by the accumulation
of soluble salts like various things Sodiumchloride sodium Calcium chloride Magnesium
chloride and so on and so forth and generallywe call it as a what you call Saline soil
with the pH value is greater than 80 rightSo and that will be you know very bad for
to cultivate anything And Saline soil of courseif it is less than it can yield less crops
so therefore one has to avoid these kind ofproblems
So Indian Soil Degradation if you look atwhat are the reason And you know that land
clearance such as clear-felling and deforestationif you go and ask to your father or grandfather
he will say like when they were there lotof forest were there because of modern technology
they are just felling the trees at a fasterrate that what human being can do with their
hand So it’s a very fast very powerful toolthey are having You might in now-a-days in
you know your media social media right Somemachines have have been developed which will
just clean the forest in may be a few hoursbig forest you know large forest so deforestation
So agricultural depletion of soil nutrientsdue to improper farming practices that what
we are saying modern agriculture practicesfarming practices not right not sustainable
not you know conducive for the Mother NatureSo therefore that is the problem Inappropriate
irrigation and over drafting - Because weare using too much of water and also you are
taking a lot of water from the ground
And Urbanization and vehicle off-roading – Lotof urbanization is urban areas are increasing;
we are taking the land you people may be knowingthat in rural areas the land were divided
Some land will be for grazing some land willbe for cultivation some land will be for making
this ponds and some land will be for whatdo you call temples So these are all being
classified and year marked But today all landpeople have grabbing you know so therefore
is a balance was made it’s a very nice thingwith we should And then quarrying of stones
sand ore and minerals all those things alsospoiling the land
Exposure to naked soil after harvesting byheavy equipment’s – Like because equipment’s
you know if you look at I’ll be talkingabout it later on that what is the depth one
has to go for during ploughing when you doBut these modern machines are doing very longer
level then then it will all dried up So thereis a big problem therefore more water and
there is a little problem with more problemabout that So Monoculture destabilizing the
local ecosystems Dumping of non-biodegradabletrash such as plastics and some other you
know chemicals and some other material evencotton with a lot of polyesters right Poly
ethylene and other things we are spoilingit You might have seen like all land are now
been spoil by them
And Soil Contamination – is a big problemso also soil erosion soil acidification loss
of soil carbon if you look at carbon is alife you know life we know from the science
carbon And the soil is you know various kindsof carbon will be there and this carbon balance
is very important If look at that you knowduring photosynthesis this will be having
plant biomass and the red one if you lookat it something gaga tons of carbon per year
you know is being during this what you callwhite is coming for during this photosynthesis
and atmosphere you are having also carbonright
And then you will get capture it with a sunlightand then soil carbon and then it will go microbial
respiration decomposition it will go backand then fossil fuel you know this cement
land use other things will be like somethingaround 9 gaga tons kind of thing so also in
the sea it is captured the carbon and it goesto the net oceans and deep oceans and all
these cycle has to be maintained That cycleis being disrupted because nature makes that
and we are disrupting So soil contents meansgreater than 12-18% organic carbon there will
be in organic carbon also are generally classifiedas a organic soil which is very much essential
for agriculture farming right
And if you look at in modern time what wehave done because of this fossil fuel we are
using organic carbons and rock carbonatesfor cement production other things right we
are increasing 54 And from the atmospherewe are giving in the carbon dioxide other
things you know gases and carbon monoxideso then you can land can take you know 1.9
kind of this giga tons and land use becauseof land use again it will go back to atmosphere
it may be coming back from atmosphere to oceanso that is the imbalance because human being
you know have creating this cycle imbalanceNature works on cycle nature works on in a
making maintaining a balance
So as a result if you look at if you lookat why it is soil is important If you look
at our history and people have found out weare having civilization we discussed earlier
that Mesopotamia civilization which was collapsedyou know some due to salination salinization
of the soil because of salt content increasingyou know and Indus Valley civilization desiccation
of the soil and again this coming the soilSo therefore you know those are the reasons
what people have attributed and of coursethere might be some other reason as well but
this is one of the major reason so also theMayan Mayan civilization which is Central
America so it has gone due to the soil erosion
And Axum the northern Ethiopia which I hadnot discussed earlier but this also civilization
600-100 BCE before this common era ecologicaldegradation even today also they are having
problem they are still doing Ethiopia AndRoman you know soil exhaustion because they
were having a large army for the food productionthey you know used the soil too much So that
you know it become a problem for them andthe civilization So therefore today if we
will not take care of soil and then we mayextinct and the civilization may be going
out So one has to be careful about that
And what are the problems using excess irrigationExcess Irrigation of land for a longer period
is called the water logging You know peoplewill be putting this water because you are
having pump and they are careless also aswell right And now-a-days government is giving
them free so free means they will put thewater and they are spoiling their soil and
spoiling and also using more what you callfertilizers because fertilizer will be going
leaching out going out so also nutrients Theydo not know what they are doing and then they
will
So during water logging condition like pore-voidsin the soil get filled water and the soil-air
gets depleted As a result root of the plantwould not get enough air for respiration because
you need some respiration I’ll be talkingabout it how it does later on when I’ll
talk about natural farming And why you don’tneed to give a lot of water what is being
given now-a-days
Water logging also leads to a low mechanicalstrength of the soil and low-crop yield We
are giving more water pouring more water becausenow-a-days farmers are not that intelligent
They are being pampered they are being noteducated and they are being told what has
to be done they have become laborers accordingto me I have visited whatever the interaction
I am having with the local area around Kanpurthey are just laborers they listen to radio
television and then do that
So therefore they don’t have their own knowledgeWhat to do They are being as if like a raw
but is doing so that is the big problem withthe society is facing today Because people
are trying to control them and they thinkthey are the right one So so also our students
they are also not learning now-a-days becauseprofessors are you know like all the lectures
they are giving and there what you call indoctrinatingthem not developing their mind Similar things
are happening
So Water not absorbed by the soil and is evaporatedleaving the behind thin layer of dissolved
salt in the top soil and the salinity youknow being increasing So the land becomes
useless So how soil and water interrelatedBecause if you look at in our system people
will say ok soil has consumed at the so andso water management system soil management
but this is the combined one has to look atit Unfortunately in this country people have
not looked at it till now So this is to belooked at
And without soil can water be retained onthe land Certainly no right So therefore soil
is very important to retain the water in thiscountry If look at a water molecule positive
charge atom bonded to a negative charge atomthat is the chemical we know When rain water
falls after condensation water vapor becausethe vapor and then will condense and then
the it will drip down as a rain droplets Hydrogenatom is electrically attracted to soil surface
neutralizing to the negative charge rightAs a result what will happen it will try to
you know this hydrogen atom is bonded to theoxygen atom and a chain of water molecule
is built around the clay particle you knowthere is say in the soil in the soil itself
So that is to be looked at it and hence itis important to look at soil and water management
together how to retain what are the thingsfor the agriculture and also the human life
Because we depend on the agriculture farmingyou know for our own life So and it is also
ecology and other things one has to look atit So as I told the food qualities I’ve
discuss a little but let me bring to yourattention that if you use the natural way
what our ancestors are doing now-a-days peopleare talking about as organic of course it’s
a more business and other things little distractedform of traditional method of farming and
the conventional is the (indus) what you callchemical way of doing modern agriculture practice
And if you look at I had also showed you earlierthat anything you take let’s say for tomato
we will take potassium right Or kind of thingit is higher here And whereas the in the natural
farming and then conventional it is 58.6 thereis a lot of difference And so also if you
take iron you know like if you consider spinachis 1584 and where as in the conventional which
is the modern agriculture practice it is 19very very less and that is of course in mili
equivalent I told it is a mili grams of thatkind of things
So and if you look at the nutrients in theorganic versus the conventional this is what
you call conventional one means chemical agricultureor using chemical way and organic means they
are natural right You will get Antioxidants88; you need not to take a tablet for that
you know It is higher than this So also VitaminC – 63 and Beta Carotene Vitamin E Phosphorus
all this Potassium are higher compared tothe chemical way for you know like modern
agriculture system Therefore we are unnecessarilytaking lot of medicine for our own just to
supplement this It is hopelessly bad So thereforeone has to look at it
And problems with the modern agriculture ifyou look at it is we have already discussed
I will not look at it but only I will tellyou the junk food we are being using like
potato tea coffee corn coca soya beans becausethese are a commercial foods and it is being
used and then you are being fed with advertisementsand lot of money being taken away and for
kids are being you know live to use that andget you know diseases and then from that we
will have to pay money and also health asthat
So therefore we will have to look at whatare current situations Increase in food prices
by more than 300% in last ten years in countryIndia right Earlier day’s food was cheap
Decrease of soil quality with lower organicmatter in last 40 years Decrease in cultivation
land in last 20 years of course there areseveral other reasons also it’s not only
the bad wrong practice of a farming Urbanizationagain lot people is all interlinked one cannot
say that Decrease cattle population last 20years people are not using them and those
are very important I’ll be talking aboutwhy we need to rear cattle Why you need to
rear animal You please think about why weneed to do
And reducing reduction grazing land for fodderand domestic animals Because animals are not
there people have taken their land we hadlocated land earlier Encroachment of green
covers 333 acres per day you know being takenby the various people ok by various groups
this booming this billing this constructionsectors They are just grabbing the land And
depletion of water bodies and lowering ofwater table – in almost all parts of our
country And 130 Million hectares of degradedland in India till 2000 – there might be
much more than that today
And Migration of villagers to urban areas– Because you know we are using mechanization
therefore they are jobless What they willdo there So they will have to come for the
job to the city Because we are using tractorwe are using all trailer all those things
and using fossil fuel and then paying moneyand then as a result you know there is a problem
also I’ll talk about the suicide of farmersAnd imbalance of nature causing the dreadful
diseases
And between 1995-2004 you know something 294066farmers committed suicide because of cost
of farming is increasing much and due to debtThis number let me tell you is a government
number I’ve taken from NCRB India but thisnumber at least will be twice than what is
being reported in this report according tomy judgment I may be wrong in my judgment
So now we know what are the things what arethe problems I’ll stop over it plus please
understand that the modern practice of agricultureis not good for us And we need to relook back
our traditional method of farming and alsoreinvent and rejuvenate and also find out
ways how to tackle the imbalances in the natureso that we can survive And it is a question
of surviving it is a question of living alife which is important
Therefore we need to look at traditional agricultureor traditional farming system more seriously
not only copy and paste the old thing ratherrelook at it with a new outlook and do research
for finding out better ways to manage ourself within this problem which being created
by this modern science and technology andthere misutilization by the greedy market
sources Thank you very much
