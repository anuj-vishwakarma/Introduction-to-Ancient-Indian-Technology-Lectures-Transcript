Let us start this lecture with a thought processthat Towns can consist of cluster of villages
with specific culture and living style asin ancient India If we recall that we started
discussion in the last lecture about townplanning in Ancient India Of course various
aspect of Harappan u civilization and theirand its town planning we had discussed If
we recall that we were discussing last timeabout granary which was uh meant for storing
the grains and if we look at the interestingfact was that it was having some uh what you
call air gap between the walls and that isa very important aspect which need to be investigated
to why it is so but as I had mentioned inthe last lecture that it is basically to control
the temperature and quite interesting thatand there might be some reasons also we need
to explore it
Let us today let us now discuss about otheraspects like well uh in the last discussion
we discussed about private wells and and alsothere are instances of public wells which
are large in size and it will be having alsoa platforms and which was were found in the
Mound AB at Harappa If you remember that MountAB that I had shown you and from here figure
you can see that this is a well which is ofcourse the scale is not given but it is quite
a large ambit and also beside this there aresome pedestal here like if you look at these
are the pedestals which are there and thismight be there is uh there is also another
pedestal here and this pedestal might be therefor uhh taking bath and also the washing clothes
as is common in many traditional cities inPakistan and India even today
I remember that when I was in a college ina hostel and at that time we used to uhh use
similar pedestal for washing clothes at thattime we were not having luxury of uhh using
washing machines of course now a days is veryprevalent very much there even in hostels
So there is also uhh working platforms foundin Harappan you know excavation site If you
look at this is a one of them this is anotherof them there is also one here somewhere So
uh these are quite huge in thing it is a havinga what you call circular in nature and uhh
a vessel which will be steady in nature andthese you can call it as a basically a motor
and motor means you know it is can be utilizefor pounding the uhh rice husk or the husking
the grains and it was might be these mightbe there in the courtyards or maybe in a very
big room and if uhh these are located in acourtyard they must be used for uhh public
purposes
So these are the kind of things what peoplefound out during excavations and beside this
there was a drainage system which was uniqueand if you at this I have shown you the drainage
system here it is having Corbelling also Thisis a quite large corbel and what they found
out it was built in middle of an abandonedgateway at Harappa to get rid of the rain
water and sewage In some of the cities eventoday we do not have sewage systems Now government
is trying very hard to garner funds from varioussources even from the world bank to build
sewage system and it was there in earlierdays and it is a very cost effective way of
doing using the bricks these are the bricksif you look at but we are using concrete for
that and which is not that cost effectiveand also the durability is a question for
concrete
This Mount E and ET they could find out uhhyou know some places to be craft works for
the quarter because they found out lot ofdebris which might have come from manufacturing
certain items in the areas if you look atuhh I think these are the some of the spots
they might have located here some pedestalhere and some places here might be some kind
of a furnace heat furnace they might haveanticipated from these identifications or
identifiers and then they could have assumedthat this might be workshops where people
were doing crafts As I had told earlier weare having the cottage industries which is
a part of like not that industry that willbe separated out like in modern days
Earlier days it was quite uhh you know simplething to do and then they were doing in home
itself and some of the things if you lookat the uhh shell ornaments and these are the
beads right these are the small beads wherepeople were using stone beads and there is
a also like a uhh some more ornaments andthis is a of course the stone tools and several
other things and people were thinking thatthere might be gold work as well but uhh there
is a one things I would like to show you Steatitebutton seals which you look at these are the
a design one and this 1 2 3 4 5 and the centreis having and there is a 2 holes here one
is here and one is here broken and these theymight have used as a button what we are using
for shirts or may be some kind of ornamentsthey will be using you know so which is a
very symmetric in nature and very well designed
So from these one can say that they are nothaving the buildings but also they are having
the other state of the art design and developmentand then of course they are making these art
works and which we call it we can call itnow in industries you know at that time If
we look at this figure uhh beign made by basicallyChris Sloan and was taken from the JM Kenoyer
who was basically researcher on Harappan civilizationsand this site is related to artistic conception
of a gateway in Mound E you can see this isyour basically a gate kind of things and these
are latish work and this is the middle andthe middle of this thing what people are saying
this is the corbel sewerage system I was wonderinghow but if you look at this it is a very compact
like you know they are using the space onthe bottom there is a sewerage system going
on and on the top they might be using as aroad
Like we do that in today also because I rememberin Kanpur city the sewage system was in trouble
they had excavated or the dig it and to repairit and similar things I had seen in Kanpur
may be 1 or 2 years back in the middle ofthe road they were doing that That means to
repair those uhh sewage system which was madeout of uhh what you call bricks And these
are the houses if you look at there are theflat roofs and there is also a 2 storey and
there is a doors and windows keep in mindthis is not the actual figure I am showing
you it is the basically people have conceivedit after looking at the foundations and their
remanence and they could think that okay thecity could have been like this okay that is
the thing
So till now we have looked at uhh basicallythe town planning in the Harappan and similar
features are there in uhh what you call othersites like Mohenjo Daro and then several other
sites I will be not discussing about it butnow we will be looking at uhh The Literary
Evidence of Town Planning in Ancient IndiaI will be just touching up on because of paucity
of time and also it cannot be covered adjustively
Of course we cannot rely on the literary workon how much about the getting the integrity
about of town planning because it will notgive the actual pictures as generally the
literary works is a little verbose even todaywhen we are writing we see that it is a little
exaggerated but however one can look at variousterms and terminologies which are began used
namely like high defence walls deep ditcheswide street large portals like busy markets
ponds and garden and etc These are all tobe designed properly like otherwise it will
be there otherwise people will not talk aboutit and uhh that can pro you know can provide
the overall views about town planning
So uhh from this one can also make out thatthere was some kind of planning in designing
the town and then placing it If you uhh lookat the RigVeda RigVeda has talked about the
houses which were built with wood bamboo orthatch uhh in Stagati in Sanskrit it is known
as thatched and even till today people areusing thatched at house what we had covered
in the lecture on rural housing and I wishand hope that even thatched house will be
coming up may be after 100 or 200 years oncethis petrochemical waste economy will be uhh
vanished and uhh there is of course a Asthadyahia Grama or book written by Panini he has talked
about uhh 2 types of words for towns Udhicyagramaand Pracyagrama
Udgicya means basically North side and Pracyameans the eastern side of this thing and one
can say that basically town may be consistof gramas or the villages at that time and
when he talks about town he also uses certainwords like Parikha means a moat or a trench
and Prakara is basically rampant and Dvarameans gate Like these are part of the fort
areas which will be fortified and these thingsand beside this there are several Buddhist
texts and of course in which Jataka storieswill be there you can find description about
uhh various you know terminology related tothe towns For example like Pattana Pattana
is a port town even in Orissa and Andhra Pradeshthere is you will find this word Pattana even
today which was a basically Pally word orthe word in Pally language and Nigamas is
basically market town and Durga is the forttown
Even town also being classified dependingupon their utility and there is a Jain text
Anupatika uhh which is also mentions certainterminologies like Parikha must be a broad
at the top and cut deep down right That meansif you look at a moat is basically trench
and it will be having a broad at the top butbottom it will be little short you know kind
of thing and which is obvious thing and thePrakara the rampant must be built solidly
and bent like a bow provided with buttressesbuttresses means the support systems with
the stone and the bricks that it will notbe broken easily it can stand you know certain
impact load and Attalayas the bastions mustbe with the Torana or the gate Gopura is basically
towers and Raja Marga which we in presentterm we call highways may have 3 to 6 junctions
of road and there are several other thingsare there also in this text and several other
texts are there which I am just giving someyou know representative kind of things
And if we look at Arthasastra by Kautalyawho is also known as Vishnu Gupta that he
says the grama means basically uhh arounda space of 1 Krosa in length and 1 Krosa means
2 kilometres Even today it is also may be2 to 3 kilometre around that place where the
people will be living together and we callit village and they were having also the officers
for collecting the taxes and managing thetowns and other thing and that is being mentioned
in the Arthasastra Sangrahana means a smalltown tax collector which is consists of around
may be 10 villages and Kharvatika is townwhich is around 200 villages kind of together
they will be taking care and Dronamukha isa big town which is chief administrator Dronamukha
means basically chief administrator of a bigtown which will be around something 400 villages
and Sthaniya who is a also a administratorkind of things of a big city which is around
something 800 villages
16:01 So if you look at earlier days the villagesculture were there in the city and also the
city will be having certain fortificationsbecause of uhh getting protected from the
enemies and the other things What we willbe discussing now some of the things which
mention in the Chanakyas Arthasasthra abouttown planning and there is a regional consideration
like what he prescribed the towns must bepositioned in such a way not only to help
people each other but also to protect it fromthe enemies There is also a problem of congestion
in the town at that time and due to the surpluspeople and uhh which must be you know decongestant
how it can be done it can be done by relocatingthe people and how it can be relocated
And he has given the idea or the precisionand that is the people can be encouraged to
migrate to a new place which might be designedproperly and people will not go like that
way they they must be given some benefit andthat benefit is to exempt them from paying
the taxes for certain years So if you lookat we are also facing the same problem today
most of our cities are populated because ofmigration of people from village or the rural
areas and for better opportunities and betterlife they are just coming to the cities and
that is being crowded and of course theremight be several ideas which might be there
in uhh also Arthasasthra or we can generateto solve the problem of over population of
the city of the present days
And when you uhh talk about village and townwhich will be newly established he prescribed
that it should be of high proportion of agriculturistsand workers that means you know the new village
will be consist of agriculturists means farmersand also the people who will be knowing agriculture
so that what will be you will be self sufficiencyin food unlike the present day uhh town uhh
planners or the town dwellers they do nothave way to uhh what you call uhh farm the
land because they do not have land to tillit or the produce the crop and it is not sustainable
and beside this that is the one way to attractthe people to come because food is available
and then the other thing is that markets wouldbe there and where the sales of good received
from traders and on the highways that meansit would be connected to the roads and there
should be also the provision for the water
Therefore it should be by the side of theriver or some canals or some water bodies
would be around or constructed so that thepeoples should have that you know day to day
activities with the help of water Withoutwater it will be difficult we will be discussing
about water and irrigation other things inthe next few lectures The new village would
have a temples and garden it should be plannedproperly because these are very much essential
for sustaining life Arrangement for the agedand children informal persons kind of things
they were having also Aged means I think itis meant basically may be for Bana prastis
like earlier days people were taking uhh youknow retirement from their household work
and they will go and teach and also do somesocial work as a part of Bana prasta which
I had mentioned earlier
And they are basically to give back to thesociety and this the houses or these things
should be there Beside this the cereals andwealth would grow if the agriculture be kept
busy that means they giving more emphasison the farming the attempts also should be
made to protect and increase quarries quarriesmeans basically the mines and forest and canals
water If we look at these are the glimpseof the town and then also villages where the
life can be sustained very peacefully andproductively Unfortunately today towns are
not being planned properly now we can learnthat integrated approach of town planning
from them
According to the Chanakyas Arthasasthra citywas used to be located central to facilitate
trade and commerce as I had mentioned earliernot only to trade and commerce but also for
the farmings and to protect it from the enemiesand site must be large enough and near perennial
water body that means the water bodies whichwill be lingering which will be there for
all the time should be there for selectinga site for new town
And also in old towns you will have to makeprovisions for that and its shape can be circular
rectangular or square or as to what will besuitable for that kind of topology where you
want to have and separate areas were providedfor marketing of different goods the protected
walls were around the town which is aroundsomething 3 to 6 Danda high and 1 Danda is
basically around 1.8 metre and there shouldbe 3 moats for to protect the city from the
enemies 14 feet and 12 feet and 10 feet wideto be constructed kind of thing which will
be 4 arm aparts and depth will be three fourthof the width they have defined something but
there might be some changes here and there
3 East to West and 3 north to South roadsyou know should be dividing each other roads
would be enough Generally people should haveyou know roads from east to west so that it
for crossing like grid kind of structure roadswhich are not prevalent today in cities uhh
because we do in a very haphazard way nowa days and the main road should have 8 dandas
wide and other road should have 4 dandas widethis means you know 8 into if you look at
something 1.8 it will be around uhh may besomething 14 15 14 metre kind of things And
the bridges and forest part should have 4dandas that means forest should be there nearby
and bridges also will be there to connectand 1 well for 10 houses that is the precision
what he has given that means 10 house shouldhave at least 1 well depending on the people
the wells would be there And this is the sometopology or the layout which is being given
but there might be several others also asper the Chanakyas Arthasastra
If you look at the place his palace is locatedhere this is your palace and whenever a palace
is there there will be temple you know becausethey are part of the things which will be
followed Beside this there will be treasurykind of things here and some industries in
this region and there will be doctors artistsand all those people will be these locations
and also the goldsmiths and if you look atthe uhh this corner side is the priest and
ministers will be uhh you know will be thereand there is a uhh cemeteries and also crematories
it will be this side where you can disposethe dead bodies and the forest and areas some
person will be there and also the forest goodswill be available in some places but at that
time forest is a part of their life becauseit is not only with the village right each
village will be having their own forest whichis uhh being considered as sacred so also
towns will be having forest area
And there is a depressed class of people whoare residing this side kind of things and
it may be amounts to be some kind of a systemwhich was there at that time If you look at
the this is the uhh you know we had seen thefirst phase of town planning in case of Harappan
and then Mohenjo Daro and Lothal and otherareas but uhh the second phase of Indian town
planning was basically again commence around600 BC kind of thing and there are several
capital cities what we call uhh Mahajanapadaswere being excavated in recent times some
of them are Kausambi Rajgir Campa VaisaliKasi Sravasti Ahicchatra and Hastinapura Mathura
Ujjain Taxiila and others several of themWhat will be doing basically we will be looking
some of these things selected one only butlet us look at general feature of these ancient
cities there will be fortifications
Fortification means like you know moats wallsgates bastions and towers these are the things
required for fortifications and they use stonebaked brocks wood gypsum and natural bitumen
uhh kind of thing and not the what we areusing today these are from the trees and other
forest we do get it and which is eco friendlyunlike the present one well planned road and
streets Alignment of the houses with cardinalpoints and streets that is a very important
point what being observed in the excavationsites and what we are highlighting now a days
you know we can put a house anywhere we likethat is that was not the case in earlier days
uhh from the excavation site what we couldlearn
And system of drainage and sanitary provisionwas very much there at that time and of course
the system of water supply in terms of wellsand other kind of this thing and people will
using kiln burnt bricks and highways werefor long distance trade and communications
and what we call it a GT road people say thatit is from the 2nd phase civilization which
is goes from uhh what you call earlier daysfrom uhh Dhaka to the Afghanistan that road
which is the main points and similar alsosouthern side there is a road which was meeting
this one earlier days and these quite oldroads right And introduction of course coinage
was there which we will not be discussingbut a lot of coinage you can see uhh also
in internet and other places and use of ironalong with other metals were a part of this
town planning and kind of things
Let us look at the first city that is theKausambi which is near Allahabad in UP which
was flourishing around from something 400BC to 400 AD and people found out a very long
fortification wall around 6.5 kilometre whichwas a quite a big you know During the excavation
they could uhh find out the main roads thatdemarks the plan of the city and every house
had access to the road directly or indirectlyby lanes This is the thing they got from the
excavation
And Ashoka Pillar was there at the centreof the city right If you look at this is the
Ashoka Pillar which was there of course nowa days it is a kind of a park kind of things
here Number of cross walls with door providedfor the security and if you look at that this
is the remanence of some of the building areasand which is used to be well planned you know
If you can look at here see it is a quitea well planned kind of thing that might be
some kind of a door kind of a things hereand there is the stairs and other things is
quite well planned and it was having a developedsanitation system with disposal of sewage
and because they could find out like soakagepits and terracotta pipes right open brick
drains and brick tanks
If you look at today people are using otherpipelines even some kind of cast irons and
then iron pipelines and now a days peopleare using concrete and some people are using
plastic but terracotta is a very easy cheaperone and we are not using today We should use
that so that it will be cheaper and durableso that we can learn a lot of things from
this ancient technology
Let us look at another city which was therein Bhubaneshwar in Orissa that was known as
Sisupalgarh and which was flourishing around300 BC to 400 AD This is the estimation what
they have made it was having defensive wallconstructed around first quarter of 200 BC
and it has a square plan each side around1.4 kilometre with a tower on each corners
This is the picture of some of the remanencebecause now a days this uhh historical site
is being taken by the others to have buildingnew buildings may be in future whether people
could government could protect this importantexcavation site or not that is a 1 question
And these are the some of the pillars whichare you can see and a rampart of clay with
basal width of 110 feet that means you knowthe ramparts width was very very big of course
the height is 25 feet which was a quite highwas erected around 300 BC later on what you
call laterite gravels were added over thelay base base was the clay the base was the
clay and then laterite gravels were beingadded and of course later on some people add
the baked bricks revetments and with the boththe sides of the uhh rampart and of course
as the people were using then they will beimproving it further depending upon the available
materials and large scale use of massive lateriteblocks for the gateway which were reinforced
by the bricks boxes filled with earth in thenext century
And the gli grid patterns layout for the roadsroad were having a very grid pattern what
is expected what is you know ideal it shouldbe and entire area was surrounded by natural
streams and the streams means basically thewater will be there and water is very important
for life we do not really plan for that andthat should be and we will be discussing about
water in the next lecture
And Taxila which is now known as Sirkap inPakistan around 400 BC this city had actually
extended fortified masonry wall the uhh spinalstreets run from North gate throughout the
length of the city uhh Of course the smallerlanes will be meeting the main street at right
angles and if you recall that this Taxilawhere the Chandra Gupta was a teacher because
there was a university where he was a professorin that place at that time when the Alexander
the Great invaded that place The horses sorrythe houses were defined and had access to
the road and it was having a very good drainagesystem as well
So this some of the layouts I have shown herethis is about the uhh Taxila city at the time
what people have got and uhh if you can lookat these are all well planned you know layout
of the houses and buildings if you look atthese are the houses kind of things these
are and this is the road you are having mainroads right These are the road kind of things
and these are the side roads and these arethe may be some common places and it was quite
beautifully designed you know town and Indraprasthaof course you will be knowing well that is
a very historian city now is known as oldDelhi and which is something 1000 BC and always
whenever Indraprastha we talk about it iscomes to our mind Mahabharata because Pandavas
which had built that Indraprastha accordingto our scripture
And this excavation revealed that this Indraprasthawhich is now in Delhi occupied it by several
people like Pre Mauryan Mauryan dynasty SungaSaka dynasty Kusan Gupta Post Gupta Rajpurt
even of course the Delhi Sultan and Mughalperiods and these I have shown you the Purana
Qila which was the place being you know captureby all the uhh dynasty people or the kings
whoever you know tried to capture the powerand they will be using that again again renovating
it also and the houses were well defined andhad access to the road We will now stop over
here and then we will discuss more about inthe next lecture and I will be continuing
this town planning of the second CivilizationThank you very much
