We will start this lecture with a thoughtprocess from Lord Buddha whose image I have
shown here which happens to be a nonferrousmetal He says that trouble is you think you
have time Today we will be basically discussingabout extraction and smelting of Zinc in ancient
India and I have chosen this because it isconsidered to be the you know first unravel
in our country in ancient time
And so you must be knowing that zinc is the24th most abundant element in earth’s crust
As a result zinc is one of the most commonmetal in use after iron copper and aluminium
This is the fourth metal which is used plentilyand you might be knowing that you know like
we use galvanised iron to avoid the rustingon it and basically that is zinc is being
coated on that And zinc is a silvery whitelustrous diamagnetic metal and zinc is hard
at the same time brittle due to its closelypacked hexagonal crystal structure
If you look at the crystal structures I haveshown here this is hexagonal and its quite
packed as a result you know you will get theseproperties and zinc is a volatile metal and
it has a low melting point around 419.5 degreeCelsius Of course I have written 419 just
to make you to remember and low boiling pointaround 907 degree Celsius but gets readily
oxidised around 550 degree Celsius in openair As a result it is very difficult to smelt
as compared to iron because of fact that theboiling point of the zinc is lower than the
temperature at which it could be smelted around1000 degree Celsius
And as soon as it will come in contact particularlyUhh the zinc vapour with the air it will get
oxidised Uhh and therefor it is very difficultto smelt as compared to any other metal So
most of the common zinc ores in India andothers other places also like zinc sulphite
what is being also known as Spalarite HereI have shown a figure that which is basically
ore and is having some structures and whereit is you know Uhh some zinc will be there
and of course in this Spalarite you may findiron also in that Zinc carbonate and zinc
oxide generally zinc oxide is not availablein you know plentily but however the zinc
sulphite is converted into zinc oxide thenyou can get the zinc metal out of it The ores
of lead zinc copper iron and silver oftenoccur together along with the zinc therefore
one has to be very carefully handle this kindof metal
So Uhh if you look at the application of zincmetal in modern time it is quite enormous
Let me just give you overall pictures likeyou know application wise as I told the construction
we use the zinc in ship building industrieshousehold electrical applications batteries
you know like and then production of alloyslike brass and then you know other metals
being used galvanising the to protect thesteel as I told earlier as a chemical additives
in rubber and paints and in automobile ofcourse we use this plentily
And of course there are several other applicationswhich I have not included here but zinc is
being used very much and it is being producedplentily Uhh So let us look at now what are
the evidence of zinc being you know minedand smelted in ancient India some of these
evidences we will be discussing because ofdue to paucity of time And if you look at
Uhh the evidence being obtained particularlyfrom Ganeshwar Jodhpura cultural complex North
Rajasthan and Ahar culture in southern Rajasthanand these are Uhh basically what you call
people obtained from there area around 5000copper bronze objects and they have carried
out ready carbon dating and it amounts tobe that these products basically belong to
second millennium BC that has been you knowchecked
And besides these 4th century BCE Uhh peoplegot brass vase in Taxila which happens to
be now Rawalpindi district of Pak Punjab inPakistan and which contains something around
33.4 percent zinc And Mesolithic site of Bagorin Bhilwara district of Rajasthan also yielded
a few copper arrowheads and of course it willbe containing some amount of zinc you can
call it basically as brass arrowheads
And in northern India also several circularrectangular punch marked and other coins of
brass dating between something 200 BC to 4thcentury AD were found out If you look at there
is more archaeological evidence of zinc inancient India it goes to the Harappan site
like Lothal and then Kalibangan another onesite in northern Rajasthan And they found
around half a dozen copper based objects containzinc around 3.4 percentage Uhh Might be this
copper will be having this what you call impuritieszinc whether they have added or not is one
question generally comes over but the timeof manufacturing date backs to something 2200
to 1500 BC
And there is another site where people gotwhat you call two evidences of brass which
is from early Iron Age dating back to around1200 to 600 BC and this site you are very
much aware This is a Atranjikhera site whichis near the river kali nadi banks a tributary
of Ganga in Etah district of utter Pradesh
So Uhh as I told earlier in Taxila large varietiesof metal objects made of copper bronze brass
iron dating back to 400 BC to the 100 AD werefound out And excavation work carried Ou by
the Birth museum and MS University of Barodaand Hindustan Zinc Limited at Zawar Rajasthan
around 1982 provides a very conclusive proofof highly developed extractive metallurgy
technology for zinc metal in ancient IndiaAnd if you look at they have also concluded
that the Indians should be credited to theto introduce this metal to the world between
600 to 200 BC
Because actually they did a very extensivestudy jointly and then unravelled as a result
later you know this Uhh around 1988 AmericanSociety of Metals recognised these sites at
Zawar mines as one of the international historicalland mines for the zinc because of this research
And I am just showing some of the things whatthey got during this research This is a ancient
zinc retort distillation they are saying thisis the furnace and these are the some you
know kind of things
And we will be discussing more about thiszinc distillation method which is being you
know they found several of them and theseare the (())(10:00) which are being you know
used for the making a house you know theseare being layered by layer they used it as
a brick in some places they found at thattime And this is near Udaipur of Rajasthan
that means lot of production of this zincmight be going on Let me tell you another
very interesting fact which has been quotedin various literature I have taken That is
William Champion established zinc meltingfurnace in 1738 Ad at Bristol in England and
started commercial production around 1743
And according to this day Uhh you know thefurnace was quite similar to the Zawar example
with downward distillation and it is interestingthat the Champion used exactly the same technique
of distillation that was used at Zawar andeven used 1.5 percent of common salt in zinc
smelting charge as mentioned in this Biswaspaper I have given the that is Joan day 1973
which is talking about Bristol brass a historyof industry And it might be happened as claimed
by the various authors that Britishers hadlearned this thing from India as they were
ruling this place and they might have replicatedthe tech you know this thing in their place
in 1738 because Uhh this zinc production wascontinuing even till Britishers landed in
this place and maybe after that
And let us look at the locations of Zinc depositsin India and these are the places lead and
zinc deposits are there If you look at thisis the Zawar region where the lead mines of
course are there and 25 km from that you knowthese are all places Deri Amba mata and there
are several places of course the other placesare there in other parts of the country The
rock in this region is Aravalli region rightAravalli mountain range The rocks in Aravalli
range in the southern Zawar are rich in zincore in the form of Spalarite and galena
These two ores we had discussed earlier withvarying quantities of pyrates in the form
of sheeted zoned and there might be veinsand stingers of course the lenticular bodies
kind of things where the zinc will be therein between And since this material are quite
distinct from each other it might be possibleat that time to separate them manually and
Uhh that I the reason why zinc mining andsmelting you know was developed at Zawar region
right that is what people are anticipating
And 7 distillation furnace of almost squareshape Uhh we will see its image like having
a dimension like this is 69 centimetre andthis is 16 centimetre were discovered in Zawarmala
hill region And these are the earthen retortplace where it will be placed and there is
also the perforated these are some holes arethere here in this region were you know being
made for the air passage and also the oresto be coming down to the furnace We will be
discussing more about it And Uhh the productionof metallic zinc by the distillation process
was started at Zawar for the first time inthe world as claimed by various people
Besides coins several other brass antiquitiesnamely lids caskets bangles finger ringa utensils
icons chariots religious objects utensilshave also being found from early historic
sites in Utter Pradesh Madhya Pradesh GujaratSeveral brass images of Buddha were discovered
from Phopnarkala of Burhanapur district ofMP and east Nimar district of MP belonging
to Gupta and Vakataka period something around500 to 600 CE
Hiuen Tsiang a Chinese scholar of Buddhismaround 629 to 445 CE mentioned about Uhh Buddha
statue in a magnificent Vihara near Nalandaduring the reign of Harshavardhan 606 to 647
CE and this statue is made of brass as itwas mentioned in his travelogue A large number
of ancient bronze belonging to Pala Sena andKalinga School of art around something 800
to 1200 CE contains considerable amount ofzinc which were found in the eastern part
of ancient India including the region of BiharOdisha west Bengal and Bangladesh
And moreover records confirm that even until1840 the tribal people of Zawar were using
the distillation process for the productionof pure zinc and that clearly indicates that
you know Britishers might have learned thisthing from the tribal people of Zawar region
about the distillation process of zinc smeltingAnd this is of course about the archaeological
evidence but there are several literary evidencesof the zinc in ancient India
One can think of Susrut Samhita and CharakSamhita Uhh which clearly mentioned the use
of essence of different minerals and metalssuch as gold silver copper tin bronze and
brass for preparing the medicines Of coursewe have discussed some of them But we are
not talking about brass which contains zincand both these texts mention that brass has
a ‘riti’ or ‘ritika’ and also theyrefer this to the pushpanjan which was prepared
by heating a metal in air and was used forcuring eyes and wounds That means this brass
can be done that job
And brass was aslo frequently mentioned inSanskrit literature as riti or ritika the
word probably derived from the Harita or yellowcolour because brass being yellow in colour
The term Kamsakuta or Digha nayaka or Dhammapada or Atthakatha was interpreted as brass
coins Besides these writings of Manu Yajnavalkyaand Pathanjali of the pre- Christian era also
refer to the bronze as kansa and brass asritika And Kautilya’s Artha sastra also
one of the earliest textual evidence of miningand smelting of metal in ancient India In
the Artha sastra brass has been mentionedas arkuta and liquid ore According to the
Gobhila Grihyasutra the Vedic students weresupposed to dip their hands in vessel made
of brass an alloy of copper and zinc
Rasaatnakara by Nagarjuna describe the methodof production of Zinc And if you look at about
the dates when it was there is a little controversyBut however Uhh one can see very clearly in
that book that it has described about a cementationprocess of making zinc And Uhh in this cementation
process the finely divided copper fragmentswere intimately mixed with the roasted zinc
ore and reducing agents such as charcoal andheated up to the temperature around 1000 degree
Celsius in a sealed crucible And the zincvapour formed dissolve into the copper regents
yielding a poor quality brass And unfortunatelyby this method the zinc percentage can be
easily controlled
But they produce this brass in a small quantitiesbecause for the medicinal purposes And objet
containing more than 28 percent zinc are calledreal brasses are made by cementation process
as well as the distillation technique of thezinc production for the first time Besides
these there are several alchemical text asmentioned about the use of brass and zinc
and these texts also mention about differentkinds of zinc ores such as mraticarasak gudrasak
and pashanrasak And Rasakalpa and RasaprakashaSudhakar of Yasodhara and Rasendrachudamani
of the Somadeva Rasachinthamani of Madantadeva are being you know were being written
something around 10 to 12 century AD explainsvarious types of brass and zinc making by
distillation processes
And these texts reveal the fact that Koshthitype of furnace were used for smelting and
the text aslo mention that furnace consistsof two chamber repeatable by a perforated
plate and Tiryakpatana Yantra were used fordistillation If you look at there is lot of
literary evidence for zinc Uhh distillationtechnique and also the cementation process
for making Uhh zinc
Let us look at what is the basic principlesbeing used for smelting the zinc in ancient
time and generally it is being produced bythe sophisticated distillation process which
comprise of mining of zinc ore and smeltingof ore and of course the final product Various
archaeological and literary evidence whatwe have seen just now suggest that both the
open cast and underground mining were beingpracticed by the ancient Indians at various
places for obtaining the zinc ore And thisis the diagram which I am showing particularly
a distillation process
If you look at this is the container whereyou can take the liquid and heat it the vapour
will be formed and then you will take thisvapour out in this tube and you cool with
the help of water or air cooling so that itwill be condensed back And this process is
basically being used for zinc production thatmeans the zinc ore is taken here and then
it will be heated with the help of of courseflame produced by due to the burning of wood
and of course I mean which is shown here butin actual situation charcoal is being used
in that retort
There it will be the zinc will be vaporisedand then it will pass through this tuyeres
or the pipe which will be Uhh can be condensedby Uhh with the help of cooling it and also
vapour being air cooled in this pipe if itis made of metal
So let us look at the smelting process andproduction of zinc in ancient India and Uhh
as I had mentioned earlier there are few metalswhich are produced by the down draft reduction
distillation technique and zinc is one ofthem because of its boiling point is very
low And what is being done in this case isthat the charge is prepared Of course for
preparing charge the ore has to be crushedgrinded and to a proper size and beneficiation
will be taken place and then you will haveto make these things you know Calamine or
the ink or with the charcoal
And then you will be putting into a crucibleand covered it and heat it may be Uhh around
1000 degree Celsius As I had told you earlierthat zinc sulphite and lead sulphite sometimes
they together this sulphite minerals are convertedinto their oxides right And once these oxides
zinc oxide is being produced then you willhave to separate it out And then this zinc
oxide mix will be again the charge will beproduced will be prepared Uhh by mixing this
zinc oxide with charcoal powder Uhh Of coursethe wood charcoal and then salt borax and
then you will have to use cow dung and waterso that it will be binded properly and then
you will have to make some kind of pelletsof ball size around 5 to 10 mm and these pellets
are to be sun dried and these ball shapedpellets are being put into a retort of length
around 20 to 30 centimetres diameter 8 to12 centimetres
Of course its volume two volumes were beingused in ancient times one is 750 CC other
was a little larger or later more than doublethat is 2000 CC And then of course one it
will be placed and then it will be it willput into smelting furnace which I will be
showing little which is of truncated pyramidshape and then it will be heated to a little
higher temperature As a result that zinc oxidewill be reacting with the CO which is produced
by this charcoal right and then zinc willbe produced and also the carbon dioxide it
will be in the vapour state zinc and thenyou will have to condense it to get the zinc
metal
So this is the what you call a vertical sectionof a zinc reduction furnace which was obtained
at Zawar Mala and this if you look at it isbasically a truncated pyramid shape and its
height is 60 centimetres If you look at fromhere to this thing is 60 centimetres And these
are the earthen retorts which are placed inthis and this will be the sectional view if
you take it will be shown here this perforatedthick plate of bricks right and which will
be holding these earthen retorts and in thisplace these are the earthen retorts And these
are small holes which Uhh will be Uhh thereto for the air to pass through and as I told
that this is the furnace is having 69 centimetresthis is basically 69 centimetres and this
is your 66 centimetres cross section
And the charge in retort were heated aroundto 1200 to 1300 degree Celsius for a duration
about 3 to 5 hours And retorts have the lengthof around 20 to 35 centimetres diameter of
course 8 to 12 centimetres kind of thingsAnd generally what happens like here the fuel
being placed and it will be burned so thatheat will be soaked into this region And then
this Uhh of course there is a lower chamberthe peg is there which is being Uhh what you
call support this brick and there is a Uhhcontainer which is being displaced a little
bit and this container is being placed whereonce this is being melted vapour being produced
and then it will be coming out
Let me show you the retort and this retortwill be containing a small pellets of spirical
size together and it will be packed in thisUhh brinjal shaped retort and with a wooden
stick in between This wooden stick right thisis your wooden stick and which will help to
support these things so that it will not falldue to gravity But another interesting thought
once it is heated to the 600 around degreesthis will be also having some carbon and giving
the reducing agent some carbon dioxide willform And also it will create a passage for
the vapour to come out and collect in thisvessel right lower chamber vessel
And the as I told the borax and the addedsalt must have been helped in low temperature
sintering of charge and slag that will beand cooling of gas leading to the sudden volume
expansion and lowering the vapour temperatureand the chilling action of air draft in the
bottom chamber might have occurred due tothis sudden volume expansion kind of things
As a result and this through this passagesyou know like your ash and other things will
be coming and also some air will be movinginto that what you call air for the combustion
of this (())(29:19) which will be in thisplace
So this is a beautiful system what they haddevised for producing zinc out of the metal
and let me conclude that zinc was no morea rare metal for ancient Indian metallurgist
as the oldest evidence of pure zinc comesfrom India only It has been accepted by the
researchers and the credit for bringing abouta breakthrough in nonferrous metal extraction
first in the world undoubtfully goes to theancient Indian metallurgists They devised
an indigenous method for downward distillationof zinc vapour to produce zinc and various
gadgets of zinc on a commercial scale Andfrom India the technique of zinc extraction
might have spread all over the world throughtrade and communication also by travellers
coming to India from time to time
Of course this is a very clear evidence whichhas been discussed earlier that Britishers
might have learned from us Uhh what they producein Bristol And therefore it can be concluded
without any doubt India is the oldest commercialcenter in the world for zinc production And
thank you very much for listening this talkthen we will be discussing more about how
to make a what you call bronze idols out ofthis metal in the next lecture thank you very
much
