Let us start this lecture with a thought processfrom Swami Vivekananda who says all the wealth
of the world cannot help one little Indianvillage if the people are not taught to help
themselves Our works should be mainly educationalboth moral and intellectual Unfortunately
today the education being important in thiscountry is lacking both moral sense and also
intellectual sense And we are not really teachingpeople how to take care of their life and
basic needs like food shelter and what youcall the cloth And in the last few lectures
we have already discussed about agricultureand also the textile and in the last lecture
we initiated discussion about housing
And we have seen in the last lecture thathow our housing was in ancient rule India
And we discussed about various aspects aboutstarting event for cultural signatures in
our houses even today it is still exist butit is just going out at an alarming rate And
beside this we looked at scientific aspectsof that if you recall we are discussing towards
end about aerodynamic aspects of the uh whatyou call roof And today we will also continue
to discuss that traditional knowledge washaving applied science We uh what you call
teach science and technology but we do notreally uh you know make them to practice in
their life So let us look at about you knowcertain more aspect about
So as we have seen like you know in a housea thatched house like several things will
be there For example in thatched house therewill be roofs here made of may be bamboo or
this basically truss there will be othersalso like an uh reefs and this you can call
it basically sparse right and this you cancall it as a revere kind of things and this
is a truss And this truss has to be connectedwith this is your basically column and all
the roof elements this is part of the roofhas to be joined together that is the first
important thing and then the roof has to bejoined to the wall and also to the uh column
In this case it is joined here but in earlierdays people were using the uh uh a coir rope
and later on also people started using thenail iron nails And again this wall to the
floor and floor to foundation which is notshown here those are very important thing
has to be joined otherwise you know structurewould not be that stable
And beside this there are two kinds of roofsone can think of one is uh angle this is the
hip roof and other is a gable roof there isa overhang here right This you can call over
hang Generally the hip angle roof is preferredover the gable ends as it is less prone to
the roof because it is secured very easy youknow well with the wall This is your wall
therefore uh it will not really uh go uh youknow out particularly when the wind speed
is very high it will not lifted out But unfortunatelyin the last lecture we had seen that you need
to have an over hang of a proper size andangle also to prevent the direct heat sun
falling on the wall particularly in summerseason And therefore it is beside this the
walls are generally in rural areas made outof mud and those wall has to be protected
from the rain for that reason over hang isalso given
So therefore you cannot afford to have a mudwall house without over hang But of course
if it is a concrete or mortar one can givebut steel over hang is required because you
will have to protect the wall And this angleif you look at this angle the angle of the
sloping of the roof must be greater than 30degree as it may produce suction of wind on
the roof leading to the blown away So uh ifyou look at uh this is a angle which is a
small if I say this is equal to Alpha rightand this of course 10 15 to 20 degree And
generally it is recommended that it will bemore than 30 question arises why Let me try
to explain you suppose the wind is cominglike this and this is having angle if it will
come this way I can resolve this with thewhat you call angle here so this angle is
alpha and this is your if I say this is velocityV this will be v cos alpha and this is v sin
alpha So therefore if the angle is small thisvelocity v cos alpha will be higher right
And then what will happen the pressure staticpressure on the surface of the roof will be
more
We can use simple Bernoullis principle likeif I say this is Pt equals P + half row v
cos Alpha square that means if alpha is smallis small is lower in the downright then what
will happen v cos alpha will be square willbe higher and then pressure will be lower
right So as a result if the small angle thenthere will be more suction that means smaller
angle will be more suction and higher anglewill be less suction If a suction is higher
then there is a more chances that roof willbe blown out Therefore uh if you look at most
of the houses in rural India and other placesalso like angle is will kept around 30 to
40 degree although if you look at if I willmake a uh a small angle roof and then the
amount of the thatched materials you knowlike straw and hay will be very low and then
cost will be lower right But still we willhave to use the higher angle because of that
it will not be blown out
So that is the kind of you know uh you knowknowledge were there in our traditional you
know uh wisdom so therefore we need to lookat that and we today we just do it and in
case of uh what you call flat roof if lookat what we do with concrete and other things
there is a big problem of how to take outthe water sometimes in the flat roof we will
have to make it slope little bit such thatthe water will be you know flown down particularly
during rainy seasons So those things conceptsyou know are very uh you know interesting
and they have done I was wondering why theyare having this inverted V shape having certain
angle People are having they may not be knowingthe Bernoullis equation at that time hopefully
or I do not know but at least they were knowingwhat has to be done and what angle and that
angle amongst to be the right one
So besides this of course the joining if youlook at this is the part of the straw this
is the limb like truss limb and it has tobe joined with the wall this is your wall
properly And if you look at this also thewindows should not be kept near the line of
the uh roof Why Because if it will be thenthere might be a chances it may uh help in
blowing of the roof because too many windwill be entering into and then it will pressure
will raise and then already this thing particularlyin the rainy season where the wind is higher
and so also other times cyclone and otherthings and therefore large opening near roof
lines are not provided You must have seenthis in a rural area ok but today we are not
we can put anywhere what we like because weare using concrete and then mortar we are
not bother about it ok People were very concernedso you can think of putting a roof windows
here in this place you know somewhere if youwant two generally people do not go for three
unless it is a big house having a width ofyou know larger width
Generally two are placed so that the uh strengthof the wall will also be lived in ok So these
are the kinds of ideas scientific ideas peoplewere having at that time So which you can
see today even like in may be in more placesyou may find the houses having this but in
modern uh you know village where the now theconcrete and motor has been used profusely
you will not find this kind of you know conceptbeing implemented because they do not know
what they are doing right So beside this thereis a ventilation system what was a very important
in ancient rural housings because air velocitycreated discomfort particularly when either
the cold or the hot air blows directly ontothe human being right You might have experienced
yourself right But if it is comes tangentiallyor with not directly then you may feel good
provided the velocity is not high so thereforethat has been taken care in the house also
It is important to have the fresh air constantlyentering the house throughout the year not
only in the uh you know summer or may be inthe uh rainy season but in other seasons that
also is important And it must also be distributeduh you know evenly to minimize the sudden
temperature change or the draft in the roomright And those are taken care and by the
two ventilation systems what you can findin rural houses one is wind driven cross ventilation
which you people will be knowing right thathas been done and other is Buoyancy driven
ventilation system
And for Wind driven cross ventilation systemwindows are provided on wall opposite of the
doors for a better cross ventilation And generallyyou know this kind of thing is being used
and this is your door right and the air canenter then and then it will and then windows
are not just front put place in front ratherit puts in the corners somewhere so that the
uh wind will enter into the room and thengo right And sometimes some windows are placed
here also in this portion you know so thatthe uh you know wind will come over here and
that depends upon this design so that thevelocity will be distributed evenly across
the room ok this is a system being placedright
And uh so also the other things and generallyhouses were designed earlier days to get advantage
of natural breeze for the houses you knowfor a house uh kind of thing and so that the
cooling you know can be kept And natural ventilationrelies on the breezes to remove the moisture
heat odors and active gases there are severalthings that is very essential to be get removed
instead of closing it Now a days you peopleare staying in air condition room and it is
all close the oxygen level goes down if youclose it And of course uh we have already
seen that you know like uh nice scenario forcooling of inclined roofs you know why we
are having in a thermal we had seen earlier
And if you look at let me look at a Buoyancydriven ventilation system here like there
is a uh air is enter right Air here and thenthere is a system over openings and then air
will come and go here Due to what they wouldbasically Buoyancy because heat will be coming
in and let me show you a little 3 dimensionalfigure right This is the air which will be
entering and then this is the sun which willbe falling the heat and then there will be
a buoyancy will be there and it will be theair will be going through this vent and then
going through this and then go up and passingthrough that Let me show you another may be
figure that will be clear
So if you look at the fresh air is enteringhere and there will be of course some of the
thing there will be recirculation and thenand it will carry this moisture dust and heat
to some extent and it will be driven by Buoyancyright it will be driven by Buoyancy And that
helps in taking out and it will be very cleanSo this is a uh you know good part of this
inclined roof and also there is a ventilationcan be provided right So those things were
there in uh earlier houses but unfortunatelytoday it is not prevailing right although
we are saying that we are very advanced right
And there is a another thing which I haveobserve when I was a kid like you and I had
visited rural areas at that time Now I amtrying to relate this attic house to the solar
drawer and also it can be used for coolingthe room Let me show you how it is It is uh
as I told this is the inclined roof thatchedroof right And there is a of course this is
your living place living space here and thisregions and there is a uh attic portion is
this like this is the wooden beam this isthe wooden beam right And this there will
be a layer of mud and then on the top of itgenerally the things like grains are been
dried because the heats is coming over hereIf you look at the solar the heats are entering
here right and then it will be dried and thenthat has been used I remember that we are
also use to store uh a lot of like grainshere so that it will be remain and the air
of course there might be some holes here someair might be circulated also in some places
there is a opening over here like that ventilationsystem were there Particularly those things
you will get in the uh you know like in somehouses you may find
And it was very good and now a days I findthat people are drying the grains on the direct
sun light which is not supposed to be becauseit spoils the nutrient values of the grain
But at that time the people use to do thisright and in the winter season this kind of
what you call ceiling what is given here onthe top of the thatched house right which
helps in maintaining the temperature in summersummer it was cool like at least I had lived
uh for of course may be for few days wheneverI visit uh whenever I had visited to my native
place a village and then it was very goodright So it was all there but today you will
not find this kind of attic house today invillage because all are people are making
concrete buildings
And mud flooring is a very important I willbe talking about because this is of course
very rare to see A woman is uh you know basicallyuh smearing a slurry which is prepared by
the mixing the cow dung with the mud and uhof course for doing that one has to soak this
the floor with the water for 2 3 hours andit is should not be too much also the water
be you know too much water must not be placedin that Otherwise it will be difficult but
that is an art one has to learn and then uhyou know do that And uh then you will have
to smear this slurry uh with uh either handor with the help of a may be some brass kind
of thing made out of cloth of course she isdoing in her own hand And what are the advantages
one may think of because if you look at thisis the free of cost because the cow dung is
available it was a part of rural India wherethe agriculture is the main uh you know way
of living
And it will be cool in summer and warm inwinter right that is the thing what you can
get and it is environmental friendly it disinfectsthe area due to the use of cow dung Of course
I had a talk with somebody they are sayingthat it is little controversial and some people
claim that it is the pathogens getting decreasedbecause of using cow dung But some other people
say something so therefore one has to be verycareful and check it But as my gut feeling
is that as the people are doing for ages togetherand they were very healthy so therefore I
would believe that it may be you know disinfectthe area But however more research is to be
done with the present context of the naturalimbalance what is happening We should not
take as it is we should check and correctverify it and then take
And also there will be little bit you knowvery little vary you can see there is a some
small up and down it is not as polish as theyour now tiles house or mosaic house it is
having something and that helps in givingmay be acupunctures and the pressure to the
thing and will be helpful for maintaininghealth and also you will not fall down there
But today where lot of old people particularlyfalling down on the floor and then going to
medical hospitalize for the breakage of legsand hands and what not But that kind of thing
beside this I am just remembering that thisfloor height also was different from room
to room Particularly for kitchen it will bedifferent for may be for your uh Pooja room
it will be different I was wondering why theywere making different But an idea came to
my mind it might be like you know the heightwill be maintained for certain utility but
the other thing is that if you move arounddo your work it will be a good exercise right
So that your bone and other things will bestrengthened you know that one can think of
And as I told this when you make it is a basicallyone has to maintain it is a good form of physical
exercise and when you do something and youget a personal satisfaction a little bit art
is required not everybody can really uh uhmake this uh mud floor right and maintain
it So you feel satisfied that you are havingcapability to do and maintain that But disadvantages
if you look at uh Skill is required but notthat technical and human labor is required
but I will put it other way around that ifyou will not do physical exercise then you
know your body will get lot of diseases particularlynow a days And it is also not very durable
that is the negative part But it is also canbe converted into advantage that is the disadvantage
can be converted into advantage if you lookat proper prospecting
So therefore uh this is the thing what ourancestors were doing in ancient India so we
need to look at it And we can re learn itand do whatever the way we can at this moment
I will be showing some of the things thatwhat people have improvise May be I will come
to that uh particularly mud wall and showhow people have improvised it And if you look
at wall material there are several of themlike wooden wall bamboo wall bamboo reinforced
mud wall grass and tree branched reinforcedmud walls reinforce is not that you know what
concrete you know mortar and then iron rodit is the people are using earlier days ok
Its not a new concept it is earlier conceptSo also people have talking about natural
geo grid wall right and of course the mudwall I will show you little bit more and stone
and mud wall I will just go through or wewill learn little bit about those things
Because if you look at wooden wall is a verysimple to do and here in can it can be the
wooden planks are being use like commonlythese are wooden planks right Uh and of different
sizes and it can be horizontal it can be verticalyou know these are the vertical things depending
on the thing and it looks very elegant andearlier days wood was very much available
but today it is a scar scarcity or is a scarceuh commodity And it is simple to connect and
erect because wood you can join very easilyright And it is easy to handle unlike your
brick or the mortar or other stones rightAnd in case of earthquake it is very good
Nothing will happen like thats why peoplein Japan they use the wooden houses you might
have studied right Even in our area you knowparticularly in Arunachal Pradesh and Himalayan
region people use to make wooden house
And failures if it will be there it will notbe catastrophic like your concrete and mortar
structures right kind of things And nice architecturaleffects possible because I had lived in a
wooden uh house which was quite good aestheticallyyou feel good about it as if you are with
the nature If you love nature you know youfeel part of it So that kind of feeling you
will get But of course it will be having disadvantagesalso like you know it will be more theft cases
like with the criminal activities going onin our country and other places So you know
it is a lot of safety issues are there andthere might be uh termite right or other insects
may be spoiling maintenance is problem thereare several other problems associated with
it
Bamboo if you look at is an extremely strongnatural fiber When I was a kind you know bamboo
was used left and right particularly in Odishabecause we were growing a lot of good bamboos
but today it is not uh and uh it is quitelighter as its specific gravity is around
0.57 its average weight is around 0.64 kgper meter like it is quite lighter that source
And very important thing they reinforce nodeslike diaphragms kind of thing prevents the
emerging longitudinal crack spreading overthe entire length of the thing Suppose there
is a crack which may likely to occur in thebamboo but it will not spread because if you
look at a bamboo there will be something diaphragmwill be here this is the and that will not
allow it to spread This is naturally availablewith that you need not to do anything right
So uh it is economical and environmental friendlyright and it can be also biodegradable And
good for Indian seasonal variation in temperaturebecause there is a lot of temperature difference
and it will be good that way And uh of courseif you look at the failure which may likely
to occur but in civil engineering the historyof civil engineering people say `never claimed
you know that bamboo is that strong and thenpeople use it And of course these are some
of the data I have just put and it is it mayvary but I have just given you uh so that
you can have a feel And you can see that thisis some variation I have given may be more
variation will be there It will be havinguh good tensile strength and is having also
compressive strength density is very low andit is having uh the bending elasticity is
quite high and so also the bending strength
So it is of course comparable with the anyother material and it is far better than the
wood even and if you look at uh of coursemetal it can be comparable to some extent
And this is the house this is a wall one canthink of having being needed this kind of
thing Even you can think of using the dressesout of the out of bamboo textiles are there
you know you might have seen like people havedone like yarn they can produce anyone can
do and this is being needed And bamboo ifyou look at it is oven bamboo wall like these
are the bamboos it is being ovened properlyright and one can say without even mud cladding
and there is a another one it will be uh theseare the bamboos right and these are being
you know like a wattle we call it wattle theseare the wattle right ok And then you can have
a plaster what you call daub right and thenyou can use it
And there are several designs one can thinkof I am showing some of them you know if you
go across the country various design in variousplaces you will get That is a this known as
whole bamboo culms like single bamboo entirebamboo right will be placed together and you
tied with a another to small bamboos uh thisthing and tied with the wire or the rope and
you can place it right So there are severalkinds of design of wall you can find I have
just shown you few of them right and one hasto of course I would suggest that you please
may be take some photography if you come acrossand if it is lying particularly in the Arunachal
Pradesh and other places still people areusing that Assam Arunachal Pradesh and other
places If you could get and put a pictureit will be nice because I was searching I
could not get actual pictures you know Sowhat we will do we will stop over here and
we will uh may be discuss in the some otheraspects in the next lecture Thank you very
much
