Let us start this lecture with a thought processfrom Rudyard Kipling who is well known Nobel
laureate He states ìI keep six honest serving-menthey taught me all I knew; their names are
What Why When How Where and Whoî These arethe very important tools for gaining the knowledge
Rather in other words converting the uhh informationinto knowledge can be done by these questions
So let us now recall what we learnt in thelast lecture
We basically started looking at the meaningof the civilization Because we had started
discussing about Indus Valley Civilizationso we need to know what is civilization If
you look at the civilization is basicallya human society which has developed in such
a way that it will be having a uhh sufficientamount of food and higher level of spirituality
science technology and also the rural anduhh urban areas in a some group they will
be developed And it will be having also aphilosophy and unique cultural values what
they live
And we also identified the characteristicsof a civilization and we also looked at what
are the contribution of Indus Valley Civilizationto the world And what we call today the Indus
Valley Civilization as Indus-Sarasvati CivilizationAnd it is having enormous and then we have
also looked at the comments made by the giantslike uhh Aurobindo and Swami Vivekananda And
also similar uhh comments uhh on the thisIndian civilization were made by several other
western scholars and they felt that Indiaíscivilization was quite rich
And uhh even today it is also living I musttell you that that Indian civilization is
still alive but whereas the most of the ancientcivilization are almost dead So we need to
relook at it and today we will be lookingat basically that why we uhh need to uhh look
at the ancient Indian science and technology
And uhh before that let me just tell you thatwe have also covered the course content I
need not to go through it But I would liketo draw your attention that you can (for)
you know refer these books like a uhh Historyof Technology in India and from which I will
be taking most of the material for this courseand which is edited by A G Bag And it is basically
published by uhh INSA that is Indian NationalScience Academy which is a well known uhh
organization in New Delhi
Beside this recently we have published twobooks: One is Glimpses of Ancient Indian Science
and Technology in 2015 you can refer that;so also the another book this Forays into
Ancient Indian Science and Technology againedited by myself So you can get this book
These are very small book You can call itas a book let not a book You can get in Amazoncom
as kind of things you can go through thisAnd some of the material I will be taking
from all these three references Beside thislot more uhh places I will be using
So now we need to ask this question: Why areancient Indian science and technology relevant
today Because uhh you know you might be thinkingthat we are at the pinnacle of the scientific
and technological development And when weare at the this thing why we need to look
at ancient that to Indians Indian scienceand technology Lot of people uhh like you
who are not exposed to the uhh Indian scienceand technology they might be thinking we are
not having anything
So if that is the assumption you are havingin your mind the natural question is why we
need to look at it So before uhh really answeringthese questions we need to ask also few question
Let us ask this question:
What are the current problems faced by humankindCan anybody tell LikeÖ
Student: (())(05:23)
Professor: Not the same thing maybe differentif it is coming to your mind
Student: (())(05:29) difference
Professor: Okay fine So what we are discussingis basically depletion of natural resources
As I was telling earlier that petroleum youknow is the engine of the modern life and
it is depleting at a faster rate Not onlypetroleum but other things as well like your
iron ore or your any other resources naturalresources you are having For example jungles
mountains
We have already destroyed the Eastern Ghatand Western Ghat which is a protective for
us as I told in the last lecture And extinctionof species there are several species particularly
in this this country India where there wasa biodiversity And the number of species were
quite high but it is receding at an alarmingrate
Toh uhh if you look at as to the review publishedin May 29 2014 in a very prestigious journal
of science current extinction rate happeningis around something thousand time faster due
to the human beings You see we are supposedto be the protector of the environment and
so also the living beings we are destroyingit And almost around 20000 species are near
extinction They may you know will not be there
And in the name of development we are doingit And why we are doing this How we could
do this Because of the power we have got dueto the modern technology So also the global
warming and we all of know that we are beingaffected by the global warming temperature
is going up You might be knowing like yesterdayit was quite hot in Kanpur in November 23rd
and today it hasÖit is changed it is littlerelatively cool right
So there is a change in theÖkind of climatechange across the globe And the climate today
you can predict There might be cold theremight be quite hot and then rain may come
in you know it is unpredictable Climate ischanging and so also environmental pollution
The environmental pollution is a epidemicstage Now theÖwe need to look at it It is
not only the air pollution which is beingcreated by what you call use of fossil fuels
for our transport and power plants and otherthings
And there is water is being polluted whichis a very important for the sustenance of
any form of life not only human being butany form of life And not only that but also
the pollution of human mind Today mind isnot at peace; all the time it is agitated
And also it is causing a lot of turmoil inthe mind of the people As a result there is
a degradation of human values Like I alwaysfeel that India is having 130 crore people
but where are the human beings They do nothave the qualities of human beings The certain
qualities are required which will distinguisha them basically uhh from the animal
So and there is a problem and an economy bankruptcyThere is a total if you look at the economy
of the entire globe not only India is on basicallygambling that is ësayerí you know business
And there is no uhh what you call constancyin that So therefore we are in deep trouble
And deterioration of law and order not onlyin India across the globe
And there is a unrest of social politicaland economical Always the you know like unemployment
there is a lot of problems around that Soif you look at these are the problems we are
facing we are facing uhh as of now Now whatare the solution What are the solution for
this And what are the causes Because if youwant to find out solution we need to find
out what are the causes right of that
Let us look at that what are the effects ofglobal warming There is a rise of sea levels
You know in recently uhh in Orissa lot ofland being lost near the what you call sewage
in Puri where the Lord Jagannath temple isthere And so also in West Bengal and the coastal
area lot of problems land is being consumedby the sea right
You might be aware the Sundarban areas wehave lost a lot of land and which is submerged
in the sea So uhh that is a big problems weareÖwe will be facing in future because the
what you call the ice being getting uhhÖmeltingout So those will beÖas a result there will
be sea rise And we I already talked aboutthe habitat damage and species being you know
extinct And their life is also very importantfor to have a balance with the human being
you know in this beautiful earth
So there is a increase in temperature Thereis no doubt about it because I remember that
when I was a kid I used to live without afan; today in the same place I cannot live
without air conditioner So therefore the temperatureis rising at a very faster rate and it is
causing a lot of other problems also And waterquality and also the quantity are in deep
trouble You might be knowing in Kanpur thewater level is going down per year around
05 to 07 meter right Going down water levelground water level
And it is not only that like inÖit is alsoworst in some other places Being in a Gangetic
Plain nearby Ganga we are better-off but inother places it is in deep trouble And so
also the quality of the water And this becauseof we are doing
Let me talk about warm winter in Himalayanregion Himalaya is a great thing for us because
it is having a very big icecap And that lowersthe temperature and maintains balance the
temperature in this region And the threatsto the (biodiver) biodiversity arising from
the climate change are very acute in easternHimalayan regions and that region is threatened
And there is a endemic species with the restricteddistribution because the species are getting
extinct Not only that you might have watchedin a TV like you know people are going and
for trekking and it has become business Lotof people are going and they are putting dumping
all the plastics and other things and spoilingthe environment
I always tell to my student who are (trek)going for trekking from IIT Kanpur ìYou please
do not go And if you are going make sure thatyou take all those out and clean that Himalaya
because that is the big thing for usî Notonly Himalaya for any other mountains are
very important for our life because they controllot of things without our knowledge So we
should not spoil them and uhh kind of things
The for example we are having technology thereforewe could manage to go to that place otherwise
no right Very few people could go So thereforetechnology may be helpful but it is also spoiling
the nature And so the regions these regionsspecifically Himalayan regions wetlands are
being affected by erratic weather observedin many parts of the region And these we are
having not only the wetlands in the Himalayanregion other places that control the environment
So those are being spoiled
And these effects uhh willÖbasically thesethings will affect the water quantity and
quality in rivers like like Ganga or Brahmaputrakind of things So because this is being fed
from the Himalaya and not only that wetlandswe know talking about basically it is not
only in the Himalaya other places also Itis almost people have swallowed the wetlands
and they have taken for their habitats andother thing
And those are the points we need to protectThey should be actually according to me Himalaya
should be no manís land no (shou) nobodyshould go there It should be protected then
onlyÖbecause uhh then only it can reallyuhh preserve the originality and we can have
that
So what is important is that in this countrywe are endowed with natural resources and
they are the players who maintain the balancein the ecology and we need to protect them
And like in a ancient time we are we are havingrules and regulation If you go to the Arthashastra
and other thing that you will find there isa reserved regions which where people will
not enter
So we know that burning of fossil fuels iscausing a lot of (pop) pollutions you know
in our city and also the other areas wherethe power plant being installed We know we
are having Panki Power Station in Kanpur howmuch a dust level how much you know uhh carbon
dioxide and other thing we emit And then weÖthatcreates a lot of problems in you know and
in around these places
So if you look at as a result this there isa increase in the uhh concentration of carbon
dioxide You know that carbon dioxide is basicallya greenhouse gas which is increasing If you
look at these are the points that these arethe experimental points And this pink color
is the prediction It is going you know uhhÖitwas basically it it was increasing at a very
smaller rate for 1750 to 1950 because youknow 1750 is taken as a (())(16:24) that was
a industrial revolution what started in westerncountries
And then it is increasing 1950 or maybe aroundthat increase at a very faster rate and today
if you look at it has crossed the 400 marksIf you look at the data November 21st 2016
this is 40354 ppm and it is quite high Andif it will go above let us say 450 maybe another
30-40 years or 50 years we will be in deeptrouble because you know like it will be causing
a lot of problem in this hall there mightbe lot of you know death and then uhh there
is a imbalance and it will go somewhere wedo not know
So therefore one has to be very careful aboutthat And and all these thing we are doing
because of the problemÖbecause of the powerwe have got from the modern technology and
the science and we are misusing it abusingit So if you look at what are the causes of
this problem This problem is basically asI told excess exploitation of natural resources
by man armed with the power of modern scienceand technology Is it this This is the only
cause or is there any other cause Can anybodytell me What are the other causes
This is one cause we know like because ifthe technology could have not there or if
the man could have not you know having thepower to understand the physical laws and
the nature they could have not done that Butis it the only cause for these problems what
are facing or is there any other causes Anyidea
So if you look at it is not that the scienceor technology are responsible It is the philosophy
of the science and technology that is veryimportant is the cause Why Because if you
look at we believe that we are a part of MotherNature but the modern scientist like Baker
or Darius who are the profounder they startedtalking about that they want to win over the
nature armed with the science and technologyHow can it possible Because we are a part
of the nature
So if if (suppo) for example I am a part ofit my hand is a part of it can my hand win
over my (bo) entire body Certainly no it isfoolishness So therefore the philosophy of
that they want to win over the nature is wrongSimilarly how can I when I am a subset of
the whole set will be winning over swallowingit No not possible And if you do that you
will be facing the similar problems
So wrong philosophy of life what for we areand whether we uhh you know like we are uhh
being consuming the product and process youknow kind of things and living a life like
a animal running from pillar to post fromthe morning to night even we will not sleep
in the night you know for doing work so thenwe do not know what is the objective of life
what is the philosophy of human life
Human life is very important because humanis unique animal in the entire uhh what you
call animal systems and theÖor living beingsSociety today controlled by the greedy market
forces Today our life is being controlledby them What kind of shirt I will wear what
kind of shoes I will wear what food I willtake what are the things we get swayed by
them
As a result we also the they they controlour health right So health and they want to
grab our wealth So therefore we are in deeptrouble And we do not have our own thinking
they are making us busy from morning tillthe late night so that you do not have time
to think and you become seized to be a humanbeing Unless you think yourself what you are
doing you are not a human being because manis a thinking animal by nature
So therefore we seize to be and we are beingmade ourselves busy for getting them to be
satisfied their greedy nature So lack of leadershipwith proper vision who will tell The leaders
today are not leader They are managers Thereis a difference between manager and leaders
So leader should have a vision not that micromanageand what is to be done what not to be done
So therefore we are lacking in leadershipnot only in country like India but across
the globe
And there is a intellectual bankruptcy Peopleare not thinking If they are not thinking
they do not have ideas they will just followersthey are not idea generators Rather in other
words they are not creative in nature As Itold earlier man is a creative creature by
nature Unless he will be creative he cannotenjoy the life So therefore he cannot come
up
So degradation of human value system: Andwhen you are become a human human being then
value come into picture Animal will not behaving value right So therefore that we are
not living a proper human life or humanityis at stake therefore we cannot have a good
value system So wrong educational methodology:The way we are being educated the way we the
way we are being taught is not right way ofdoing So therefore whole problems are tantamounts
to that
So and on the top of it lack of spiritualitySpirituality is a natural state and which
we have forgotten in the name of developmentin the name of modernity So therefore these
are the very important causes of the problemsSo therefore if you look at these are the
causes of problem then what are the solutionAnd uhh we are now trying to answer the question
why we need to look at ancient science andtechnology and how to go about it
And uhh I have already identified the problems;we need to find out solution So we will stop
over here and we look at in the next lectureThank you very much
