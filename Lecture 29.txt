Let us start this lecture with a thought processWater is the prime mover of life in this beautiful
earth So in the last lecture we were discussingabout the irrigation system Let us now look
at another irrigation system which is knownas interconnected tank irrigation system
A figure I have shown here in which if youlook at these are various big tanks and these
tanks are connected with a smaller tanks ormedium sized tanks and then this medium sized
tanks is connected to a smaller one Peoplehave found out something 1500 tanks around
a seasonal river Palar that originates inKola district of Karnataka In this river the
water flows predominantly east into the Bayof Bengal between Chennai and Pondicherry
And similar systems were also found in theKaveri Delta what I was told and if you look
at there is some data I would like to mentionhere that something 11 large tanks which is
more than the one million meter cube can holdaround 60 percent of the total water storage
while remaining 187 tanks can hold only 40percent
And these tanks if you look at the generallyin each year the smaller tank are get filled
up but whereas the larger tanks when thereis a flood or very big (())(144) of water
in the river then this will be the biggertank will be field up and these are all connected
And as a result you can have you know waterstorage in all these tanks so that in semi
arid regions like this where unreliable rainfallconditions prevails then we can utilise this
water tank systems optimise the what you callwater usage and other things so that you can
get crops as a result the food security youknow will be ensured But problem with this
kind of tanks is that there will be siltingas well and those needs a regular maintenance
So if you look at this is quite sustainablesystem and around that water is already there
and you can have crops right It is not thatit is located it will be going for kilometres
you know so that in between you are havinga scale where you can have your crops
So sustainability appears intrinsic to thetraditional Indian methods Nowadays the way
we do we talk about sustainable but sustainabilityis the part of the design in ancient India
So that is very important thing what needto unfortunately these are not being maintained
and these are all dilapidated condition andwe need to revive this if we really we want
to have a passive irrigation system Theseare not active irrigation system this is a
passive irrigation system inter connectedtank irrigation system In other words interconnected
tank irrigation system is the passive oneunlike the your dam and well it is active
Let us now look at another hydraulic engineeringsystem which was there around 100 BC and in
Sringaverapura in Allahabad district of UPand this work was excavated by BB Lal and
if you look at this is the Ganga water rightthis water is flowing in Ganga and there is
a channel which is coming from Ganga duringthe flood particularly the water will be flowing
through this canal and which is around 11meter wide and 5 meter deep And during that
flood time what will happen the water willcome over here there is a tank which is basically
silting tanks which will you know like suchthat the silt will be settled down in this
place and then from that the water withoutsilts will be coming to the second tank which
is having a brick lined right and this firsttank the silting tank is having no bricks
And as I told earlier from the silt tank orthe first tank the clean water was directed
to the second tank lined with bricks and thenwater is filled to the third tank which is
again with having a stepped inlets If youlook at these are the step inlets will be
there and again the water will come over hereand there will be also a fourth tank it has
it is of course circular in shape these areall rectangular in shape but this is circular
in shape It has an elaborate staircase withelaborate waste weir kind of things will be
there and consisting of seen spill channelwhich are not shown here like one channel
is here there might be seven spill channelsa crest a final exit this is the exit here
if you look at this is the exit excess waterback into the river Ganga
So if you look at during the flood what willhappen you will take this you know collect
the silt around and when the flood is notthere you can clean the silts and that the
silts to the field and utilise it as a manureand again the water can be recharging this
area by the side of this river Ganga and ofcourse that will be designed properly so that
your recharging of water will be going onand then crop you can get very easily That
means the it will not flood the areas it willbe utilised again it will go back to the Ganga
So this is a beautiful system hydraulic engineeringsystem which can be even utilised in modern
times right Of course more research is tobe carried out how to do that and what are
the things but it is not being used in moderntime
Let us look at this another dam which is Surjakundand Anagpur dam this is in Haryana which is
having a kind of a water will be coming overhere and stored and silted and all silt will
be removed from this place and then afterthat of course it will be steps It will go
up and this is the downstream view of thedam which is there and Surjakund lies about
3 km south east of Tughlaqabad in the stateof Gurgaon
The reservoir is believed to have been constructedin the 10th century by king Surjapal of Tomar
Dynasty around 1000 AD and let me tell youtoday the dam is being protected by the ASI
but unfortunately lot of things are beingtaken over the land the catchment area and
other places by the local people And thisdam is an impressive edifice of 50 meter wide
and 7 meter high built from the accuratelyhewn quartzite blocks These are the quartzite
blocks and of course some work is being doneby the IIT Delhi Dr Biravali who had done
some work maybe some other people might haveI had a talk with him and then he told that
it is a beautiful system In this dam whatwas happening there was a during the rainy
season the water will be flowing from thelet us say up stream to the downstream in
the spring season there is another under streamwhich were there uhh you know that will be
going from the left to the right side of thedam
And there is a sluice system sluice gate systemwhich you know these are the gallery and entry
into the dam where there will be sluice systemand these steps into the gallery inside the
dam And this is the sluice outlet from thisriver right there is a sluice outlet in such
a way that what will happen like in the rainyseason the water will be going flowing from
this side to that side and the other seasonor the where it will be dry there is spring
which is coming That means there is a watersluice system that water will be coming from
this side and that side so both the cropsthey can do in the different you know both
the sides
So that is the beauty of this system whichyou know what according to Dr Biravali of
IIT Delhi who was trying to investigate thisand concluded this way So if that is the case
then this a very interesting structure whichyou know was built by our ancestors we need
to be re looked at from the engineering pointof view Let us look at the inundation channel
of Bengal flood plains This is your riverbed through which water is flowing this is
one embankment and there is another embankmenton the other side with a cut in it
And there is a channel which will be you knowduring the flood time this channel will be
coming to the field and these are the fieldswhich will be there As a result what will
happen the coarse sand will be here and riverduring the flood the fishing and the fine
silts will be passing through this channeland it will be the whole field will be inundated
during the flood That means it will be supplyingthe silt which are having nutritional values
you know to the field where the crop can bemade According to sir William Willcocks a
British irrigation expect flood water enterthe field to the inundation channel These
are the channels right and water brings inreach silk and fish and the fish fed on the
mosquito larvae and helped check malaria inthis region that was the interpretation what
is being made
And it was prevalent just before 300 yearsback and got destroyed during British rule
and also there was a war Afghan and then Marathawar and during that time also this system
was not maintained properly as a result thisis being not in use And of course after Independence
and other things nobody really bothered aboutto look at it and this is a very simple system
which were built earlier and people were knowingwhere to locate this canals and how what will
be the distance how much distance is requiredlot of calculation lot of data you know is
required to design that one
And as I told the canals were broad and shallowcarrying the crest waters of the river floods
rich in fine clay free from coarse sand asI told the coarse sand will be here but whereas
the fine sands and then the silts will begoing Canals were long and continuous fairly
parallel to each other and at the right distancefrom the each other for the purpose of irrigation
Irrigation was performed by cuts in the bankof the canals which were closed when the flood
was over That means if the there might besome sluice gates or gates or maybe they will
be cutting it whenever it is required anddo that in a regular pattern so that the soil
gets fertilised by the slits and also thewater
The Johads of Rajasthan which is basicallya rain water storage tank used in the state
of Rajasthan which is an arid areaThis isknown as Khadin or the Dhora designed by the
Paliwal Brahmins of Jaiselmer which is anindigenous check dams to harvest surface runoff
water for agriculture based on the principleof harvesting rain waters If you look at there
is a rocky up line regions will be there andthe water will be flowing and then there will
be bunds right Bund means basically it isa dam and then water will be collected here
and then it will be stored For example thisplace is a new one that where the dam is being
built over in this region and if you lookat these are the catchment areas the water
will be stored here with this bund or thekhadim what you call
And of course in the downstream this regionyou can have a shallow dug wells because the
water will be seepage percolate into it andit will be recharging this area This being
a lower or the slope and then you can utilisethis for the irrigation purposes and even
for using water for general day to day affairsAnd generally long like around 100 to 300
meter earthen embankment is built across thelower hill slopes lying below the gravelly
uplands for that you need to choose it properlythe place and sluice and spillways allow excess
water to drain off There might be some sluiceor the you know the spillways so that it will
not you know affect these uhh what you callthe bund to be broken due to the water heads
So let us look at another irrigation systemin the western Himalaya that is known as Kul
irrigation system
Generally these are the glaciers which arethere part of Himalaya and it gets melted
and diverted into the Kul in these areas andthere will be diversion channel you know which
will be making this one kind of things andsubsequently water gets collected into a tank
you know these are the tanks right and thiswater can be distributed for the irrigation
purposes this is the channels And if you lookat this is beautiful system which were there
I think till 1980s in the Himalayan regionwhich was maintained by the local people but
unfortunately government interfered and thenthe how system collapsed and it was being
maintained and they were charging the peoplefor you know for some revenue for supplying
the water and it was managed well
Let us look at another irrigation system thisis known as Bamboo drip irrigation system
in Meghalaya region They were using the hillyareas they will be using the bamboo pipes
these are the bamboo pipes right which areused in those regions and used by tribal farmers
of Khasi and Jaintia hills Bamboos divertwater from perianal springs on the hill tops
to the lower reaches by gravity and it willbe coming in a very very slow manner And what
people have found out something 18 to 20 litresof water entering bamboo pipe system per minutes
gets transported over several 100 meters youknow finally get reduced to 20 to 80 drops
per minute at the site of plant There mightbe lot of losses if you look at these are
the bamboo pipes and then water will be transportedAnd if you look at they were managing to irrigate
their land and cultivate also
If you look at this India geographical mapwe are having various regions To start with
the Deccan plateau arid region the irrigationsystem will be different This is the flood
region the gangetic planes this is a heavyrain regions in Assam Meghalaya this is a
mountain region and these are basically dessertand arid region in Rajasthan the Rann of Kutch
etc So the same irrigation system cannot beutilised all the places But unfortunately
modern time people just put a dam and thengo I ahead and do that So there is an indigenous
technology people had developed earlier accordingto their need and their understanding and
today it is not those things technology arenot being utilised unfortunately and that
has to be (re) revived so that we can haveyou know depending on the need and local materials
and technologies people can use the traditionalrain water harvesting systems
Let us look at the reservoirs which were usedfor irrigation system in ancient India So
this is the Bhimkund reservoir which was basicallybuild by Paramara Raja Bhoj around 1005 to
1055 and large dam cum reservoir which isaround something 650 square kilometre known
as Bhimkund reservoir by merging 365 rivuletsand carefully directed various dams of moderate
sizes It had maximum depth of nearly 100 ftthese dams you know like whether the width
See today people are talking about joiningthe rivers it is ancient time people have
joined the rivulets and this rivulets willbe coming from these mountain regions and
then they have joined
There is a lot of story about it I am notgoing to talk about it you cans see that They
were having some knowledge about it but todaythose knowledge are not really with us and
we need to re look at it I would like to suggestthat instead of joining the rivers which are
very mightier big it is better to first getexperienced joining the rivulets what our
ancestors have done and get some experienceand then you go and do join those rivers big
rivers if the need arises The dam wall ismore than 1 kilometre long now serve as a
road connecting the Mendua village with BhojpurAnd the upper lake the bada Talab what we
call or the big pond until March 2011 it wasrenamed Bhojtaal This is the Bhoj photograph
or the statue they have installed here inhonour of great king Raja bhoj who build it
And this is the topology of the Bhimkund reservoiror the Bhojtaal this is the bigger lake which
is there and there is a smaller lake in thisregion Lower lake they call this is called
upper lake and these are of course if youlook at Bhopal railway station and Bhopal
airports all other thing this is a very biglake still this lake I there According to
the W Kincaid 1888 Bhimkund reservoir wasthe largest and most beautiful sheet of fresh
water in peninsular India that is his claimand it is the major source of bringing water
for residence of city serving around 40 percentof residents with nearby 140000 meter cube
of water per day as of few years back
If you look at this is the Kamla bund whichis basically this is the big lake and this
is a small lake kind of thing and top of thewidth of Kamla bund is around 120 meters and
height of 18 meters it carries even a heavytraffic today Hardly any repairs being carried
out since then and it is there And this isthe location of what you call Kamla Park if
you look at this region and this is the upperlake and this is the lower lake And of course
the Pul Pukhta is this region And this isthe Kamla park lower side lake and which is
not being maintained properly and this wateris stagnant and also lot of plants are being
growing here which might be causing some pollutionas well one has to look at it
22:13How was it built The present study byK G Vyas a former advisor Rajiv Gandhi Watershed
mission and director of WALMI MP that is MadhyaPradesh confirmed that technically sound and
economically viable site the narrowest gorgewas chosen by engineer of the tenth century
They have built this earthen bund which issomething 87 feet to 40 feet height were constructed
one at the river Betwa and other to divertthe river Kaliasot at right angles to meet
Betwa Pitching of this earth filled bundswhich is not shown here was done with dressed
stone blocks these are the stone blocks theywere using the local red sandstones weight
around 1.5 to 2 tonnes
These blocks were laid on either sides ofthe bunds on one and the other without mortar
but fitting so truly has to be water tightthis is a very important technology one can
think of Whether is it possible Today I amthinking that how they are making the stone
that they will be water tight right and isit a you know we can repeat even with modern
technology What technology they were usingand also very important thing they were using
very local materials at that time
Wherever they will go they will find out localmaterials and use of durable whether resistance
construction materials has survived for morethan 1000 years and the height of the bund
was decided with such perfection that canwithstand excessive flood during this life
time Of course one has to look at what kindof technology what kind of judgement they
were having what kind of design they werehaving we need to do research on this and
unbreached dam wall even after witnessingweathering impact for more than 1000 years
still in good condition that is of courseI have taken from K G Vyas report and this
statements
These big stones were there this is the typicalsection of masonary work in Kamla Park in
Bhopal and this is of course still water andthis is the large stone are being used and
after that it is a dry ashlar and this isashlar in lime you know reduces its width
and then of course you use ashlar coping kindof things smaller ones that they were also
managing the silt deposition because the siltdeposition primarily depends on the relation
between the inflow in the reservoir and outflowfrom the reservoir In the upper lake the ratio
of reservoir area to catchment area was keptaround 1.61 to 100 only See what will happen
if it is 100 the velocity will be reducedif the velocity will be reduced the silt will
be deposited there before it is being transported
And whenever it will be dry then you willuse this silt and then you know for the crop
production This ratio allows maximum siltdeposition 3 meters in 1000 years negligibly
small as compared to modern dam which ensurethe pollution free water bodies That means
what it indicate that engineers of ancientIndia knew the construction of perennial sustainable
water bodies with built in provision of siltremoval at no cost unlike the modern system
where silt you know has to be removed andthen at a very larger cost and it is causing
lot of problems to the most of the moderndams built by in modern India
Let us look at certain data about Veetammareservoir which was built around 1000 AD This
was built by Rajaditya Cholas around 9007to 9055 AD it is around some 60 KM long dam
with mean width of 4.8 Km in Northern TamilNadu and this reservoir gets water from Kollidam
via Vadavaru river That I have talked aboutKollidam basically in the river Cauvery River
as a part of systems and its circumferenceof the tank is around 40 km when it was full
with water This renovated lake located 235km from Chennai is one of the water reservoirs
from where water is planned to be suppliedto Chennai in 2004 because this is a big water
body and then it can be utilised Always Chennaiwas having even today it is having problem
of water
But this project was unsuccessful as it gotdried up and subsequent digging of 45 deep
bore wells around the area could able to providewater between something 50 to 100 MLD MLD
means million litre daily That means whateverwe had built if we could maintain well you
know it can solve the problem of water evenin modern time Surplus water of famous Colaganam
Tank ruined condition that is today by theChola Rajendra in around 1012 to 14 AD at
Gangaikonda and Solapuram was used supplyits water to the Veeranam reservoir through
a canal That means if you look at it is interconnectedtanks were built in ancient India around that
places and very interesting things I musttell you that certain rules which were mentioned
in the Artha Sastra was also followed in South
That is water in the lower tank excavatedlater on shall not irrigate the field already
irrigated from the higher tank And naturalflow of water from higher tank to the lower
tank shall not be stopped unless the lowertank has ceased to be useful for 3 consecutive
years So these are the rules can be appliedtoday also so that lot of disputes can be
you know solved because if you follow certainrules which were their earlier in the psychic
of the minds of the people naturally you knowit will be better for this And with this I
will stop over and we will see some more reservoirsin ancient India which are still being used
and also can be revived without really muchtechnology uhh this thing But however we need
to study and improvise the methods of revivingthem in a natural way than the artificial
way being done for the making money Thankyou very much
