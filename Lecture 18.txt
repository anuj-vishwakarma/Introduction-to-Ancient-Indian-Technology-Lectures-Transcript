Let us start this lecture with a thought processfrom Mahatma Gandhi He says A country remains
poor in wealth both materially and also intellectuallyif it does not develop handicrafts and its
industries
So we know that Mahatma Gandhi who was a hardenedsupporter of the making cloth using the hand
and therefore it is having we are having alegacy of cotton making by ourselves Let us
recall what we have learnt in the last lectureIn the last lecture we looked at the question
why need to have you know cotton industriesparticularly in handlooms which is having
the historical base and then we looked atthe evidences in literature starting from
Ramayana and Arthasastra and other thingsAnd also we looked at that the cloth making
was there even in the during Indus valleycivilization
Later on we also looked at what are the sideeffects or the drawbacks of modern cloths
and unnatural dyeing being used in the moderncloths and which is causing detrimental effects
not only on the health but on the water andalso air to some extent so also the soil is
getting contaminated So later on we movedinto the also the various aspects of the cloth
making in India and each state is having thetheir own design of fabrics and also the kinds
of looms they are having
Today we will be looking at basic processesinvolved in cotton making or you can say textile
making And if you look at handloom textiletechnology is consisting of these things one
is making of the fiber right How to make thefiber from the main ingredients for example
cotton or maybe silk or maybe linen or thejute like how you will make the fiber then
the question arise
how you will weave it Weaving you know weavingof the cloth to the fabric the loom structure
and of course you will have to use the dyesto have you know better color and attraction
for that And these three component we willbe discussing we will start with fiber and
how to make fiber from this and let us lookat the basic processes involved during textile
making in ancient India
And even today that is true but in ancientIndia people were doing all the thing by hands
and they were using certain simple technologiesfor that if you look at like spinning of the
cotton jute or linen or silk fiber or variouskinds you know is the first important things
and that is the basically will be coming fromthe raw materials And then of course the you
can color or the dye it this fibers or youcan color it after making of fabrics you know
and this fibers will be converted into yarnsand this yarns means thread means basically
thread and weaving of this yarn will giveyou the fabric or the cloth
And this dyeing it can be done printing onthe fabric itself and also you can as I told
earlier dye the fiber also dye the yarn itselfso that you can get various designs and make
a various combination of colors and designkind of things And if you look at like the
as I told earlier that in India that the designwas you know like various kinds even in a
single state that means if you go to eachregion you will be having their own design
and even like various kinds of looms theywere having and as a result the creativity
was intact due to the weaving and the designingof the thing
And if you look at various tools being usedfor weaving the cloth manually and some of
the tools I will show you and this if youlook at this is a kind of a spindle and this
we call it as a drop spindle and in Hindiit is known as Taklis and there are various
kinds you can get in the country But the basicprinciple remain same and it will moving around
and the yarn will be produced from the cottonAnd there is a also a very old this kind of
instrument which is known as basically somearrow kind of things which will be discussing
little later on and this is a very old inthis our country
You might have seen you might have seen inyour local areas and even still It is being
used and this is used for carding the cottonright Which it will be for cleaning and also
making it the separated out and there is ahand tool which is being used which I will
show you how you can use this tool the handcarding tool this one I am mentioning right
And which can be used to make kind of a Punisof the cotton
And there is another one which is roller cardingtools and which is a little recent one you
can think of but again you can use a handto carding that And of course you will be
knowing it is a very famous and then kindof charkha we call or a wheel spinning wheel
and this is the another form of this charkha
This is a table top spinning wheel and thisis of course a loom which is a traditional
loom by hand and which will be discussingsome of this design but some of the designs
are not you know being used today and it isgoing out of our culture because of power
loom And this is known as shuttle and whichwill be carrying the bobbins of the threads
or the yarns like threads and which will bemoving or it will be part of the you know
weaving process and which will be discussinglater on
So what I would like to suggest that you justkeep this tools in your mind so that it will
be helpful as you go along to understand thisabout their functions and then how it is being
used
So how to make a fiber cotton right If youlook at we will have to the basically start
with the cotton which we will get from theby cultivation from the plant and we will
have to collect it and collection is veryimportant and it will be continuing the seeds
right This cotton seeds and this seeds hasto be separated and that we call it as a Ginning
Ginning is basically mechanical separate separatingprocess in which cotton fiber will be separated
from the seeds and it will be baled bale meansstack of cotton together in a particular shape
what you can think of
And then you will have to do this CardingCarding is a process by which the cotton lint
is cleaned and straightened out right Andthat we call it as carding and of course the
last process what we call is a Silver makingand it is a basically a process of making
a thin strand known as silver and you cancall it also as a cotton Punis or the rolls
right And this will be the same one can usebasically from this rock cotton from the plant
you will be getting making this cotton Puniswhich will be used for making yarns
So therefore this process has to be done andlet me just tell you that the cotton seed
can also be utilized for making oils and whichcan be used for various purposes And it is
important that you know this has to be separatedand also it can be utilized so and if you
know that is the reason why it is importantto be separated properly and collected
So let us look at the story of cotton to fiberbasically how to convert the cotton to fiber
I will show you a video which is availablein the YouTube you can see that also but let
us look at how it is being made let us seehow the cotton can be converted into a fiber
with the help of this video which I have takenfrom the YouTube I am really grateful to this
old lady who has really demonstrated thiswork and you can see that she is now making
a Punis and this Punis she has made from theCarding using the Carding tool by the hand
and this Punis is of course from India andthis Punis she has made now she is showing
you that how to make the yarn from this Punisusing a drops spindle
And let us see that how the Takli or the dropspindle work in more detail and this video
Here is the machine gun of the nonviolencemovement in India and the key to independence
It is known as Takli a substitute for thespinning wheel for those who are moving about
and are unable to devote the time requiredfor the spinning wheel
It costs but one cent and can be convenientlycarried about so that each spare movement
while talking with friends or traveling orlistening to lecture can be devoted to spinning
Here is my cotton for spinning yarn Cottonis grown clean and supplied in India by Indian
labor Spinning is very easy and can be learnedby anyone even a child in a few days If a
man works at Takli during his spare momentspare moment about four hours per day he will
be able to spin four hundred yards of yarnwhich is sufficient to supply his own clothing
consisting of his cap his shirt and his dhoti
He spends an extra hour a day on spinninghe will be able to supply yarn for those who
are unable to spin and thus eliminate thepurchasing of foreign cloth So let us look
at the basics of cotton textile and as I toldearlier this is basically the raw cotton and
we will have to make this cotton we will haveto utilize this cotton to make the Punis and
from Punis we will be making the yarn
The question arises what do mean by yarn Yarnis basically a long continuous length of interlocked
fiber used for weaving and knitting or knittingAnd you can in simple term you can say it
is a thread right That we will have to makeby twisting so that it will be having more
strength And the standard measure for lengthof cotton yarn is basically hank and one hank
is seven six seven meter that is the unitwhat is being used and there are two types
of yarn is used one is Hank yarn which isbasically used for handloom production and
which will be looking like that this is basicallythe hank yarn 
The other one is the cone yarn which is usedfor the mill productions like in a mechanized
one this is basically cone yarn
And the process of converting cotton fiberto yarn is quite complex and that is why we
were using the Taklis which is a very simpleone charkas is also being used and the fibers
are to be separated first and then assembledin to loose strand which is basically known
as Carding and carding tool is very old inthis country according to the historian Joseph
Needham bow instrument was used for cardingwhich is also known as Kaman Kaman means bow
in Hindi and dhunaki
So this is been shown here the Kaman and Dhunakiwhich is being used for carding and this is
being tied over here with the string and thenyou can use this for you know carding purposes
you might have seen and even like I thinklast year I saw in my native place and for
what you call cleaning the cotton old cottonwhenever we make a mattress we will have to
clean and then make this loosen this cottonand this is still being used and that is from
where when it was 200 AD right So eighteenhundred years still we are using
That is the technology we are still havingand it is a good one and which is used for
loosening the texture of the fiber by vibratingthe string the string has to be vibrate this
has to be vibrate here and you can make thatthing easier and it will be you know hanged
from the top so that you can utilize veryeasily And of course the strength and fineness
of yarn is generally dependent on the staplelength of the fiber and skill of the spinner
so you need to be a very good hand to do thatbecause it will be twisted so that it can
take the strength you know for the thing
As I told earlier that yarn can be producedin two ways one is you know by hand and which
was being used basically in our country inthose days and today also but of course nowadays
machine is being used that is the mechanicalprocess for you know converting the cotton
to silver and then spun by hand in variousthickness like that is also can be is being
used today in our country even in handloomsectors
And mill sector it is the machine which itwill be doing and it will be consuming lot
of the energy and this here in this case noenergy will be you know utilized rather you
will be using what you call hand and thendoing a you know it is good for exercise physical
exercise
So what is hand spinning that is the thingwhich we will see that It is basically process
of converting the cotton into yarn and ofcourse two devices are used one of them is
drop spindle which you call it Takli and theother is the spinning wheel what you call
it charkha
This drop spindle as I you know you mighthave seen earlier also that is this is the
fiber bunch or the cotton you can call itas Puni that is going through this group and
then it is having leader string and this isthe shaft and this is the whorl which will
be can rotate you know and this is a one typicalcase one can think of local people might be
using made out of wood and this is the dropspindle and spinning wheel which is the improved
version of this spindle drop spindle or Takliwho was invented around may be something 500
CE
So if you look at this is the the spinningwheel and which I have shown here and this
also known as the charkha and if you lookat this is the wheel components having the
wheel and this is there is a spindle whichis not shown here and this wheel and the spindle
is basically placed on this wheel stand andthere is of course nowadays lot of pulleys
are being used in this place also to improveits performance
And the during this spinning process the fiberis to be held generally the left hand if you
are a right hand person but if it is a lefthanded person it will be the other way around
right And the wheel is turned slowly withthe right hand this is bigger wheel which
will be basically helpful in making this spindleto move properly so that you can twist it
And holding this fiber by this lady in thishand whatever I have shown in this figure
is very important particularly for maintainingcertain angle such that it will provide the
strength to the yarn right
It cannot be 90 degree it is having certainslanted angle and which I will show you in
the next video and the drawn fibers are heldat some angle to the spindle as I told not
vertically and so that in their each slideoff at their end of spindle an twist is added
that means more twist will be added with thisand then when it will when this hand will
be moved towards this then that means willrotate and it will be founded on the spindle
itself That means you will be collecting thethread which will be made out of this fiber
bunch or you call Punis
If you look at the Charkhas is very old andin 2015 that Government of India actually
produced two stamp which is having the MahatmaGandhi picture and Mahatma Gandhi wrote in
Young India thirteen October 1921 The callof the spinning wheel is the noblest of all
because it is the call of love and love isSwaraj so at that time he was trying to get
you know Swaraj and also become independentcountry but unfortunately we have not achieved
Swaraj till now
We are depending on the other countries toomuch at this moment of time and we need to
follow Mahatma Gandhi According to him thecharkha represents Swadeshi that means we
will be doing all the things from our owncountry self-sufficiency and at the same time
inter dependency because today people wantto be independent
I always tell to my young friends like youthat independent is not possible you will
have to dependent but what is important isthe inter dependency that means you will have
to appreciate others work also and why accordingto him wheel is the center of cotton grower
weavers and users
So therefore it is very important let us nowlook at like you know types of charkhas or
the spinning wheels and there are of courseI have noted down four but there might be
several others also One is the Bardoli charkhaand this charkha which I have shown is a stamp
again Bardoli Charkha and this is the actualmodel one can think of there is a if you look
at this act like a you know pulley systemmean this is the bigger pulley and this is
a smaller pulleys And there is also a theimproved version and this is the pulleys as
I told there are more number of pulleys arebeing placed here This is the so that you
can improve its performance and this mightbe they might have started from a place Bardoli
this is a movement for a popularizing thecharkha and other things during the pressure-independence
time as a historical thing That might be theBardoli and there is also you can say it is
on the ground you can keep and then keep thatcharkha
There is a table top charkha which is calledPeti Peti means it is a box you can keep in
the box also and carry with you right it iseasy to carry and this also known as table
top on the table itself you can put and dothat work And beside this there is a Amber
Charkha which was being used basically inthis place in this photo by the Rajendra Prasad
who was the first president of independentIndia
And this is the mechanized one there mightbe here you can have one spindle in this case
one spindle here but here there are more thanone it can be two it can be four And at that
time it was being you know designed and thenfabricated and it is far superior than the
hand one The yield of this yarn making ismuch higher as compared to the traditional
charkha
And in current time of course there is a e-charkhapeople are talking about it and in this case
this is according to me it is a improved versionof the Amber Charkha they have two spindles
also it can be four spindles it can be sixspindles even till eight people have made
it
Lot of gear and arrangements are there whichare not showing you And beside this there
is also another improvement in the local leveloccur like they will be using like this you
know wheels of the cycle and then do thatand this also the bamboo like you know the
steel you know local people they do designthe thing which you call indigenous design
and the improve over the traditional one
So therefore these are the kinds of thingswhat you can think for there might be several
other varieties which I have not really collectedit and also looked at them but you may look
at it and then if you come across more thanthis you can let me know
So let us now look at how does a Charkha workCharkha in itself is one of the most beautiful
and effective modes of entertainment My nameis Dr Sita Bhimbrahw I am seventy five years
old I was eight or nine years old when Gandhijihad such an influence that each house owned
and spun charkhas and sand about charkhasWe keep spinning the charkha until we attain
Swaraj Every Wednesday from 3 pm to 5 pm charkhaclasses are held at the Gandhi Bhawan
The numbers of students have been increasingday by day I do not call them students I tell
them that I teach you what I know and youcan teach me what you know Each child has
a talent they just need to find a way to useit It makes me happy when I see the joy these
children get when they are spinning the charkhathe most thing I learned was the peace of
mind and the concentration
While spinning charkha you have to concentratea lot with just because of the didi over here
we are also learning the peace of mind andhow to keep calm I was a person who was very
short tempered before I joined the courseand after joining I started with interactive
sessions with didi I started being calm downand be more active This hobby is not that
spinning charkha to earn money or anythingit is a mainly based on the concentration
The sense of self dependence this will giveto you and most precisely the simplicity this
will provide to your life which is most worthything in the current age
When you are spinning the charkha you arecompletely immersed in it Your mind does not
wander Our eyes and hands are on the charkhaand we keep spinning it We do not listen to
anything around us but the charkha we arenaturally not distracted by anything There
are three things that Sita mam has asked usto take ahead in our lives Firstly to spin
the charkha dutifully and secondly to wearkhadi clothes lastly to lead a simple life
I am hoping to follow it as much as I can
So if you look at you can learn from thisvideo that charkha is very important producing
the yarn but at the same time it enhancesthe concentration level and also the peace
of mind So if you look at in modern days whendigitization is going on you can think of
digital India we are facing a lot of problemamong the young people and also maybe the
later on with the old people of concentrationof the middle aged people concentration and
this problem can be you know solved by usingthe charkha for spinning purposes and it can
also be utilized for getting a peace of mind
Let us start this discussion about moderne-chakra which is basically improved version
of Amber charkha and as I had showed you earlierthis is having a lot of gear mechanisms are
there and which you know quite complex innature for designing and developing And this
is a two spool e-charkha and various componentsit will be having basically spinning units
which may be of single one or two one or fourone or eight spindle maximum eight spindles
can be accommodated in the e-charkha
And it is having a unit lighting unit whichis made of basically LED bulb And it is having
also transistor radio normal AM FM tuner kindof things where you can really listen to the
songs and then programs And it is also consistof a generator and battery because you need
electricity for running this LED bulb andthe AM or FM tuners
So if you look at benefits of using only twospindle charkhas is that you will get enough
must if you just spin it for 2 hours and youcan manage to you know produce yarn of length
of two point four kilometers right And itcan provide also light output or back up of
7.5 hours of course for a single bulb maybeAnd spinning of this two spindle e-charkha
for 25 days less than a month will produceyarn sufficient for a single bed sheet bath
towel and a shirt So if you look at if youjust spend two hours right And for 25 days
you can manage to get yarn enough to do meetyour need
And one can also listen to the what you callprograms on radio and it will also make your
body and mind fit and energetic If you lookat it can be utilized very much in the rural
area where electricity is not gone but theywill also use electricity to some extent So
it is a very you know good part and the improvisationand what I was trying to advocate basically
to improvise our technology in the moderncontext not copy the old technology and use
it here today which cannot be So that ourpeople can get and then they can keep the
ethos that leaving eco-friendly
So let us look at the bobbin winding whichis the every important thing for the cotton
making because the yarn in the hank from isto be wound unto a bobbins in this process
Let me show you a pictures over here and thisis basically the hank if you look at and this
is your bobbin right Which will be woundedproperly and this is the first step basically
transforming the yarn from the hank formedto the linear from which will be utilized
for basically making warp kind of things
And this of course the yarn or the hank yarncan be dyed before and also and it can be
put into the bobbins with the help of charkhaswhich will be much easier to do that And typically
19 to 20 bobbins are required to for a 5 sareewarps of length of 34 meters If you look at
in a saree you know lot of threads are thereyarns are being utilized and which has to
be properly managed and with the help of youknow winding over the bobbin
So weaving is basically followed after thespinning process The spinning has to be done
first and it is basically the interlacementof warp The warp is a thread running longitudinally
in the loom and if you look at this one thisis your warp This is basically the warp you
can say and this is your weft the blue colorone and which is perpendicular to the warp
thread and are to be you know knitted properlyso that you will get a cloth
Basically if you look at the warp and theweft what we call tana in Hindi and weft is
the bana tana bana right In other languagesit will be different also but generally we
use that And this has to be done in the handso therefore we call it basically handloom
Warping is a process you know like the becausethis is the very important one that this is
the length wise threads which has to be arrangedproperly generally on the street or a very
you know open space it has to be done andit is very tedious and work which is to be
done by the hand and of course nowadays thereis a lot of mechanized way of doing it But
we always emphasize earlier days and todayalso in handlooms to be made by hand and this
is the set of base length wise and that runsalong the length of the fabric This this where
is the length of the fabrics kind of thingand through which this weft has to be passing
through And that is the basic design of anyfabrics This is the simplest one and of course
nowadays with the help of machine very complexfabric design has been you know developed
So with this I will stop over here and thenin the next lecture we will be looking at
basically the kinds of looms and how you knowwhat are the various parts of it and the how
it functions and we will see in the next lectureThank you very much
