Let us start this lecture with a thought processthat is more we go away from this traditional
agriculture and textile technology by adoptingmechanized methods more we drift from the
humanity while inviting awful anarchy in IndiaOf course you might be thinking why it is
so Because this is will give you peace ofmind also sense of achievements by doing it
And the body and the mind will be balancedand also will be self independent right So
therefore and it will also give employmentto the populous country like India So therefore
it is important to keep our traditional technologymay be little bit improvised person but the
basic philosophy of staying with the MotherNature will be on the back of all these developments
So let us start this lecture with Santa KabirDas most of you will be knowing he is a legendary
weaver and a great poet and whose Dohas arestill popular And he was a weaver by profession
and if you look at this is the loom what itwas having and unfortunately I did not get
details about this loom which I have shownhere If you look at these are the warps and
these will be cloth and kind of things Thisis quite interesting there are several looms
people were having earlier days but thoseare gone with the passage of time due to the
blatant use of the modern power looms
So Indian handlooms if you look at technologyare a very important one and then let us ask
a question what do mean by a loom Of courseby this time you will be aware but that loom
is basically a device for making cloth byweaving or knitting of yarn and thread right
That is you can define that way and wheneveryou use a hand for operating this loom we
call it as a Handloom And Handloom industrywas a cottage industry in ancient India And
it was a part and parcel of most of the youknow not only most of the people not only
in rural areas even in urban areas earlierdays but today it is not the case And this
is a green production and the employee youknow the employment oriented work can be done
and by this so there in other words it produceslot of employment as I told you also and given
you data earlier
So Weft winding is a very important one andgenerally the Hank yarn for weft is wound
into a pirn or a small bobbin bobbin kindof things which are I have shown you earlier
And this weft yarn is then inserted into ashuttle if you look at this is a typical uhh
loom and this is the shuttle which will becarrying this small bobbin right for the weft
And this device you know is basically movinglike in these directions and coming back in
the other directions and that will be by whichthe weft will be wrapping up the warp and
then you can make a cloth out of it
So if you look at this is a typical one loomwhat I have shown consisting of various parts
to start with the Warp beam and which willbe having these are the warps right and these
are the threads yarns and being placed properlyand this will be separated if we look at this
is known as heddle and there will be holeshere right in this heddles right and this
wire will be going through that like And thereare two heddles here which will be going up
and down and depending on the some threadsor the warp will be going up corresponding
to this and this is the lower one right andit can be operated by hand these heddles and
it can be operated by the leg also And thisis your reed and this is the beater this portion
is the beater also they call it as sword thisyou call it as a beater or this is beater
or is called sword also
So uh and it is having these are the whatyou call uh weft will be moving through with
the help of shuttle as I told you earlierit can move towards from left side if it is
left side here to right and from the rightto left whenever this heddles will be down
so that this warp which is on the bottom willgo to the top And the cloth is being formed
and the cloth is being warmed to the clothbeam here
So uh uh if we look at let us look at thisprocess of weaving here with the help of this
a video So if you look at here these are theuh beater or the sword which is moving and
this is the reed and through which this isthe what do you call the shuttle is moving
up and whenever is moving the hand towardsthe left it is the moving towards the left
side the shuttle and when it is on the rightside it is moving to the uh what you call
right If you look at the leg here leg is willbe making the heddle to move up and down and
that will make the thread to go up and downIn between this there is a weft here through
that shuttle will be moving so that the weftwill be going through the warps So and then
of course you will have to press it towardsthe your side so that cloth will be made and
this is the process by which it is being done
And let us look at another loom that is knownas Loin loom and loom parts And this is having
various parts I have shown in number thatis the one is Bamboo serves as a same purpose
as a warp beam in the horizontal loom and2 is the thin bamboo rod acts a lease rod
which will make it to you know lift it sometimeswhenever required and this bamboo shod which
will be making you know for shedding thiswarps kind of thing separating this warps
which you call shedding And the bamboo heddlesticks which will be help going through this
loops that it will be separated out And thisis the wooden beater which is being used for
after the weft being passing through the warpto bring this closer to the cloth uh that
wooden beater is being used
And the wooden rod uh this thing uh servesthe same purpose as a cloth beam in the horizontal
loom And this is the leather back which hasto be give little you know what you call tension
over the whole thing and that will on theback of the weavers which will adjust And
this is a continuous warp which is there hereand this is the woven (fa) uh fabric what
it is will be having And the this is the Masspread Mat spread on which the weaver will
be sitting and this is kind of things arebeing used very much let us look at how it
will be working
So if look at this is the Lease rod throughwhich this warp will be wounded let us say
this is the odd yarn or the thread or thestring whatever you call and this is going
down right this is on the up and this is goingdown right and then uh these are all being
done in a systematic way odd and even orderfor all the warps And bamboo shod stick will
be there will be separating both the boththis odd and even yarn or the warp this And
this is the heddle rod which will be usingyou will have to lift it up and down and there
is a loop through which this wire will begoing that is the your warp will be passing
through and this is the yarn to make the heddleright these are the ends there This will making
a loop here and this is the weft which willbe knit to be done with this process and if
you look at this is the similar one only thingis that in this case the bamboo shod is being
separating out but the heddle rod is liftedAs a result it has been the space is created
separation between this the even warp andthe odd warp is made and then so that weft
can be passing through it Right again thisis going from left to the right side and again
you will have to take this heddle positiondown and then it will be going from right
to left and making a group like that So thisis the process how it is being done with this
Loin loom and basic process remains same andnow we will look at a video right and so that
it will be clear how it is functioning
I am ready towards the shed that is controlledhere by the shed stick So then I am going
to place my sword or my beater in the shedtight out here the beater keep my sword on
the side more leaning back and the shed willpop open Keep my hand inside this and then
rotate my hand with the beater and beat NowI can pass the weft taking the weft firmly
in the shod leading a loop taking the sidedrawing the weft and gently till it just touches
the last warp Now I am going to earthen theheddle shape ok I place my hand like this
against the heddle hook my thumb over thetop and I am going to roll the heddle forward
and at the same time taking tension of thewarp by laying forward Then you can take the
shape with earthening and there is a rainysticky work here or just wave them off with
my thumb the stick has earthened very cleanlyPlace my sword or beater inside and draw the
warp down to the weaving line take the weftthinking drawing the weft in
So let us look at another loom that is thePatola loom and uh uh and various parts if
look at this is the warp beam and this isthe ditto of that same one like and this is
the stick which is being warp to this woundto the this warps and cross mechanism with
indented stick these three are and this isthe shed rod which will be helpful to make
this separation of this warps And this isthe pressure bar this one is the pressure
bar and this is the handle right And thisis the heddle rod mechanism uhh which will
be helpful to separate and this is the swordwhich is being used uh for uh used as a beater
so that the warp will be coming closer tothe cloth And this is the shuttle which will
be passing through this V shape of the warpsbetween the warps it will be passing through
and this is the of course the breast beam
And if you look at this is the same thingwhat we have seen from the side views And
this is the warp beam and this is the dittosame as that And then this is the stick which
is being used to separate this thread andthis is the cross mechanism with indented
stick and mainly it will give a tension sothat this will be separated out and this is
the shed rod and this one is the pressurebar with the handle it will be giving the
pressure so that this will go down I willshow in the next one And this is the heddle
rod mechanism which will be uh helping toactuate with the help of this hand and this
is the sword which will be pushing this weftto the cloth side and this is the cot cloth
beam So if you look at now it is like thisand when you keep a pressure with the help
and with the help of this heddle this heddlewill be pulled out to the lower string to
the up and then this will be going down becausethis is the pressure is there so it will go
down
And this through which you know like thisif you look at the warp will be passing through
and with the help of the sword it will bebrought closer to the uh cloth So uh and this
is of course the cloth beam And these arethe same thing whatever over here so uh let
us look at how does a Patola loom works andit is and it is basically from Gujurat and
also other places it will be there And thisis the handle which is is using here and this
heddle is coming out and this is the designwhich is coming that this is the (ba) what
you call beater which is coming closer thisis the beater which he is using the hand for
pushing the beater And uh this is the shuttlewhich moves by that way and uh and this design
is a quite beat you know and then it is veryuseful Of course two persons are doing but
a single man can also handle this
So that is another frame handlooms which isvery easier the same principle it will be
having warps here and then with this weftcarriers there will be it will be going this
side left to right and again it will goingto left to sorry right to left of course there
is a things which will be changing this thewarps orientations so that it will be moving
one over the other So this the same principlewhat but it is the hand one and is a very
simple one even you can design in your homeand then do that
There is a another one which is known as pitloom it has been used in several parts of
our country And the Pit is being producedhere and these are the heddles which are having
and you can use these heddles uh and theseare the warps going on and the cloth being
produced and certainly this transform fromone box to another these are the main features
and people claim that to control moisturelooms are settled in the floor that may yarn
get you know get moisture kind of thing ThisI do not know how the moisture control takes
place and what will be the size of the PitI could manage to get data And production
quantity of this loom enhanced as comparedto primitive loom so uh therefore uh it is
having advantage therefore people have usedthis Pit one has to explore how and why it
is
And uh the advantages of Pit Loom is uh basicallytexture fabric can be produced by this loom
And it can accommodate a great quality ofweft yarn in the pirn winding package And
average weaver can weave in case of pit loomlike it Is not because of it is not that you
need to have a balance between the leg andthe hand It is little easier because all is
being done may be by the hand itself So becausetheir coordination is very essential And Fly
shuttle and back beams have been introducedhere to remove some fabric faults such as
yarn breakage and knot because this fly thisthing shuttle will be done by the again with
the help of hand and which is easier to dothat so these are the advantages of the pit
looms
And uh let us look at another very interestingthing a Tablet Weaving Apparatus like which
looks like a this things like uh it will behaving this the card which having here in
of course it is a two holes there might beseveral four holes this is the warp tight
And it is a very simple systems and this isthe ends of `Dhabla being finished with the
card weaving This is the product what willbe getting out of it and this card can be
of various designs it can be uh five holesit can be four holes like triangular it can
be hexagonal kind of things saves you candesign your own and depending on the design
And these Tablet Looms uh are still used inWardha Gujurat for making Dhabas in shawls
or body garments or weav weaving tapes ortying bundles of religious manuscripts because
not very big cloth can be made out of thisbut strips can be made very easily And is
still used in even if you want you can youknow make yourself this thing with the help
of a even small wood and this thing you cando yourself in your home it is very easy to
do that
Let me uh also show you that how does it workwith the help of a video so that you will
be you will be appre you will appreciate thehow easy it is and this is the card which
is being used and these are the threads andso this is the weft which is passing through
you can look at it Like it is a very easyof course easy few sheds you can rotate this
card so that this some portion the warps theone set of warp will go up and down and then
you know like that way it will create a spacein between through which the weft can go from
left to right and right to left that way Rightand this itself is uh you know where this
yarn weft can use as a beater Lot of functionalitiesbeing embedded into the same single sort what
is carrying in the hand right So that is thebeauty of this simple system and which is
known as Tablet Weaving And you can design differently 
and the design of the fabric will be dependon the card design or the number of holes
under the things what you can manage
So let us look at the dyeing process whichis uh you know basically a method of col colouring
the text for its beautification and it canbe done uh in during the manufacturing of
textile itself uh sorry it can be done atany stage of manufacturing textile it can
be fiber it can be yarn or it can be in thefabric stage itself So uh the colour such
as red pink orange purple green etc are obtainedby using different natural ingredients and
particularly in ancient India people wereusing the natural one not only in ancient
India in other parts of the world also theymight me using earlier days the natural uh
pigments for the colouring and besides thisa mordant which is also known as dye fixative
uh was used and which aids in chemical reactionthat takes place in between the dye and fiber
so that dye will be getting absorbed to theyarn or the fabric
And we will uh look at some of these thingswhat we use what our ancestors were using
uh Red if you look at for getting red we lookat the pur pulp of Halila that is the Terminalia
Chebua or Haritaki Haritaki is basically aAyurvedic name you can and flower of Dhao
or alum alum is a basically mordant whichis nothing but a fi Dye fixative And what
you need to do that you know the process willbe like this you will to boil all the ingredients
together in a pan and then dip the cloth init turn it with a wooden ladle or some other
things and when the material has absorbedall the dye take it out then you will have
to rinse with the water and dried it and thenwash it for few times in a clean water And
this is the usual process what will be Letme tell you one thing that the Pulp of Halila
is being used here but there might be severalother you know kinds of uh natural flowers
that this wood or even the seed can be utilizedI will be showing you the next light about
uh you know what are the varieties we canhave
Let us say pink colour for getting pink colouryou get kachnar bark the alum and again the
same thing dip the material in alum waterright and dry it that is a little different
one and boil the bark of kachnar in waterclean the liquid dye material and they dry
it This process is little different than thefirst one At here first the uh cloth has to
be in the dip in the alum water and dry itand then you boil this one and put this cloth
into that And for getting orange of courseyou can use Turmeric Shahab I khasa and lemon
this another natural material and which ofcourse is is in Urdu Add a lemon in the turmeric
right and Shahab I khasa and dye the stuffin the solution I think lemon here it will
be use as a dye fixative may be right I guess
So uh for getting purple colour pulp of Halilais to be taken and Hirakasis AND flowers of
Dhao and you will have to boil the Halilain the sulphate of Iron this is use as a basically
may be like a mordant clean it leave the materialin the liquid dry it ok and subsequently boil
alum in water of course the alum also is beingused Dip the material dry it mix well of the
flower of Dhao and all together This processis a little complex boil it in water and dip
the material in boiling liquid keep in turningit with a wooden ladle so that it does not
burn and the dye is evenly absorbed by thewhole piece And you will have to take the
material out rinse it wash it four times ina pure clean water dry it and then beat it
into a smoothness So if you look at this processis given and then you know like one can also
find out their own pr way of uh you know byheat and trial
And if look at the blue colour we can getfrom Indigo that is a nil which is a basically
from India And the Shahab I khasa and sourlemon and uh of course lot of research has
to be also done and might be there also soyou will have to look at it that what makes
this each constituent you know what are theroles been played by each constituents has
to be we look at what can be done here firstcolour the material in Indigo and water solution
Add sour lemon in the Shahab I khasa and thendye the material in this solution So that
means different procedure is given for thedifferent kind of things one has to appreciate
that And for the another colour green youcan say Kabuli madder which is a red and rind
means you will take the outer skin of thepomegranate you know pomegranate we use particularly
in winter season it comes and that can beutilized for the as a part of colour and you
will have to use alum which is nothing butthe mordant All are mixed together then boil
and strain the liquid dye the material anddry it subsequently
Off white is a vermillian which is being usedand saffron starch which is also being used
And pound the vermillion with water dye thematerial and dry it boil the saffron in water
and strain it And colour the material in theliquid and again dry it then after that add
the starch in the same liquid dip the materialand dry it right And this is the procedure
which has been laid out of course one canyou know find out it and trial and then see
that is the optimum method of doing it orthere might be better method and people have
used therefore it has been quoted in the literaturewhich I have used one paper and I have taken
from that
And as I was telling that sources of differentcoloured dyes and mordants can be several
of them In the last table what I showed youone of each of them But for example for the
getting Red dye we can use Safflower CaesalpiniaMadder Log wood Khat palak Indian mulberry
Kamala and Lac And if you look at these arethe parts to be used like Flower Wood Wood
and Flower even insect right that also canbe utilized as a colour And different mordant
mostly is alum but there is a last mordantis the Tin Tetrachloride which is commonly
known as Stannic chloride right And similarthings will be there for other colours also
I am having those data but I think I willnot load you with this so many data and if
you want you can really utilize it
So let us look at Printing Because it is verymuch you know were used in earlier times even
today also it is being used And basicallyit is a localized dyeing which is undertaken
manually on the cloth itself by differentmethods and we will be discussing about them
and we will be discussing about this two methodsone is block printing and the other is kalamkari
printing And block printing if you look atwooden is generally used and the wooden block
or uh you know uh is the simplest one andwhich was used in earlier time and it is uh
of course one of the slowest method of textileprinting And even the stone can be utilized
and some other material let me show you thatthis is the uh block which is made out of
wood and you can make a design by engravingit you know and uh then you can have various
design
And block of different shapes and sizes aremade by cutting the wood or the engraving
it right depending upon your design And topof the block has a handle like if look at
this is your handle for printer to grasp itor hold it And each block has two or three
cylindrical holes which is not shown hereright is not shown here These holes cylindrical
holes are used for the passage of air so thatit can really help to dry the things and also
it will allow excess dye to squeeze out duringthe printing Like there is a two purposes
will be there one is of course for uh passageof air and also to squeeze out dye which will
be given for the printing So uh printing iscarried out generally from left to right by
dipping the block in a dye first and thenpresses into uh it on to the fabrics And of
course this is a practice one has to do andlot of concentration is required for doing
that because if you make some error then youknow it will be spoiling the whole uh fabric
or the cloth
So let us look at now a you know how doesthis hand printing work by looking at a video
So if look at this one he is trying to makea design out of wood by you know engraving
it uh and then it is pressing it by the thisis the handle and these are the various design
what is been shown here and this design you know can be utilized here
So there is a Kalamkari is another printingwas used extensively for cotton fabric in
earlier days which incorporates the patternon the fabric through the dyes not through
the loom right because it is of course a uhby the later on this you know pattern is being
placed on the cotton later on uh by the KalamkariKalamkari means Kalam basically is pen this
thing and uh is an art form and a fragmentof Kalamkari printed cotton fiber has uh been
found in Moenjo Daro which goes to the yourwhat do you call Indus Valley Civilization
something around may be 3500 BC So this isthe one I have shown here the uh Kalamkari
work in this place it will looks to be veryintricating you know lot of patience is required
Kalamkari prints uh two technique using ofcourse block and other is hand drawing And
the what one has to do is that first to maybe uh you know print or make a line sketch
on the cloth with the help of a charcoal stickor any other uh kind of colour pencil and
followed by the reworking of the contourswith the kalam or the pen And this is the
another work which I am showing it is a veryquite intricate and lot of work and patience
is required to make this So uh and these arealso being use today in our country because
we are very good in you know even today weare having love for the art and then we are
good in doing that so therefore we are stillusing it of course it is very lower intensive
Let me show you a video like how this Kalamkariprinting carried out on a cotton
And this is now all set for the best of theartist to begin by sketching the motives with
dried charcoal sticks The black colour obtainedfrom processing iron jaggery and salt water
is applied first Alum is used as a mordantto text the colour Once the outlie is complete
the details are filled in with a various coloursall of which extracted from vegetables roots
and barks and a marinate of natural sourcesThe different sues are layered in different
stages and treated for fixing The picturescome to life as pinks yellows greens and blues
emerge as they are applied and fixed withgreat care to prevent the colours merging
with each other Once the artist completesthe work on the fabric it is left on the river
bed with a right side to the sand The riversun and sand these are the final colours in
their right intensity and the fabric meetsthe river for the final wash before begins
its travel to tell the stories it carries
So let me now you know conclude with few remarksthis textile technology what we have seen
If you look at textile technology was nota rare technology for ancient Indians as some
of the oldest evidence of textiles come fromIndia only And adoption of modern technique
had a serious impact on textile sector aswe had seen and discussed due to which the
production is increasing but the employmentof people and self innovative skills of people
are decreasing with increase in trash or wastageof fibers rigidity in design and complexity
in over all process And also we are losingthe creativity which is the innate nature
of human being with our people because ofadoption of these mechanized method of textile
production
And eco friendly dye and sustainable processfor textile production should be encouraged
which was a part of our ancient culture andproper method for its implementation should
be developed and followed And we should workit out little bit mechanization may be we
call for but not that we will be using uhyou know electricity and other things and
it will be very costly also More researchand traditional textile technology without
resorting to the mechanization is the needof the hour and so that we can develop lot
of employment and also keep our creativityand peace of mind and also the satisfaction
level with us So various policy initiativesscheme interventions like cluster approach
aggressive marketing initiative and socialwelfare measures handloom sectors should be
under taken to revive our ancient technologyby increasing the income level of weavers
and overall growth of various processes associatedwith this and this must be integrated with
agriculture
So what I would like to suggest all of youthat you should get experience in this by
doing little bit this yourself because someof the things loom technology you can develop
yourself Like your card technology and thenother things which are simpler one right so
which you can do like Tablet weaving apparatusand other things you can do very easily And
beside this I would suggest if you could visitsome of the existing handlooms and make a
video and also learn yourself and send usso that next time we are incorporating your
videos in our course for the education purposeThank you very much
